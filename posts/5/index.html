  <div class="entry-content"><p>My colleague <del>bsmedberg</del> njn is going to be removing asynchronous plugin
initialization in <a title="Remove support for async plugin init" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1352575">bug 1352575</a>. Sadly the feature never became solid enough
to remain enabled on release, so we cut our losses and cancelled the project
early in 2016. Now that code is just a bunch of dead weight. With the
deprecation of non-Flash NPAPI plugins in Firefox 52, our developers are now
working on simplifying the remaining NPAPI code as much as possible.</p>

<p>Obviously the removal of that code does not prevent me from discussing some of
the more interesting facets of that work.</p>

<p>Today I am going to talk about how async plugin init worked when web content
attempted to access a property on a plugin&rsquo;s scriptable object, when that
plugin had not yet completed its asynchronous initialization.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Plugins/Guide/Scripting_plugins">described on MDN</a>,
the DOM queries a plugin for scriptability by calling <code>NPP_GetValue</code> with the
<code>NPPVpluginScriptableNPObject</code> constant. With async plugin init, we did not
return the true NPAPI scriptable object back to the DOM. Instead we returned
a surrogate object. This meant that we did not need to synchronously wait for
the plugin to initialize before returning a result back to the DOM.</p>

<p>If the DOM subsequently called into that surrogate object, the surrogate would
be forced to synchronize with the plugin. There was a limit on how much fakery
the async surrogate could do once the DOM needed a definitive answer &mdash; after
all, the NPAPI itself is entirely synchronous. While you may question whether
the asynchronous surrogate actually bought us any responsiveness, performance
profiles and measurements that I took at the time did indeed demonstrate that
the asynchronous surrogate did buy us enough additional concurrency to make it
worthwhile. A good number of plugin instantiations were able to complete in
time before the DOM had made a single invocation on the surrogate.</p>

<p>Once the surrogate object had synchronized with the plugin, it would then mostly
act as a pass-through to the plugin&rsquo;s real NPAPI scriptable object, with one
notable exception: property accesses.</p>

<p>The reason for this is not necessarily obvious, so allow me to elaborate:</p>

<p>The DOM usually sets up a scriptable object as follows:</p>

<pre><samp>
this.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__
</samp></pre>


<ul>
<li>Where <code>this</code> is the WebIDL object (ie, content&rsquo;s <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> element);</li>
<li>Whose prototype is the NPAPI scriptable object;</li>
<li>Whose prototype is the shared WebIDL prototype;</li>
<li>Whose prototype is <code>Object.prototype</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>NPAPI is reentrant (some might say <em>insanely</em> reentrant). It is possible (and
indeed common) for a plugin to set properties on the WebIDL object from within
the plugin&rsquo;s <code>NPP_New</code>.</p>

<p>Suppose that the DOM tries to access a property on the plugin&rsquo;s WebIDL object
that is normally set by the plugin&rsquo;s <code>NPP_New</code>. In the asynchronous case, the
plugin&rsquo;s initialization might still be in progress, so that property might not
yet exist.</p>

<p>In the case where the property does not yet exist on the WebIDL object, JavaScript
fails to retrieve an &ldquo;own&rdquo; property. It then moves on to the first prototype
and attempts to resolve the property on that. As outlined above, this prototype
would actually be the async surrogate. The async surrogate would then be in a
situation where it must absolutely produce a definitive result, so this would
trigger synchronization with the plugin. At this point the plugin would be
guaranteed to have finished initializing.</p>

<p>Now we have a problem: JS was already examining the NPAPI scriptable object when
it blocked to synchronize with the plugin. Meanwhile, the plugin went ahead and
set properties (including the one that we&rsquo;re interested in) on the WebIDL object.
By the time that JS execution resumes, it would already be looking too far up the
prototype chain to see those new properties!</p>

<p>The surrogate needed to be aware of this when it synchronized with the plugin
during a property access. If the plugin had already completed its initialization
(thus rendering synchronization unnecessary), the surrogate would simply pass the
property access on to the real NPAPI scriptable object. On the other hand, if a
synchronization was performed, the surrogate would first retry the WebIDL object
by querying for the WebIDL object&rsquo;s &ldquo;own&rdquo; properties, and return the own property
if it now existed. If no own property existed on the WebIDL object, then the
surrogate would revert to its &ldquo;pass through all the things&rdquo; behaviour.</p>

<p>If I hadn&rsquo;t made the asynchronous surrogate scriptable object do that, we would
have ended up with a strange situation where the DOM&rsquo;s initial property access
on an embed could fail non-deterministically during page load.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s enough chatter for today. I enjoy blogging about my crazy hacks that make
the impossible, umm&hellip; possible, so maybe I&rsquo;ll write some more of these in the
future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In February of this year I switched teams: After 3+ years on Mozilla&rsquo;s
Performance Team, and after having the word &ldquo;performance&rdquo; in my job description
in some form or another for several years prior to that, I decided that it was
time for me to move on to new challenges. Fortunately the Platform org was
willing to have me set up shop under the (e10s|sandboxing|platform integration)
umbrella.</p>

<p>I am pretty excited about this new role!</p>

<p>My first project is to sort out the accessibility situation under Windows e10s.
This started back at Mozlando last December. A number of engineers from across
the Platform org, plus me, got together to brainstorm. Not too long after we had
all returned home, I ended up making a suggestion on an email thread that has
evolved into the core concept that I am currently attempting. As is typical at
Mozilla, no deed goes unpunished, so I have been asked to flesh out my ideas.
An overview of this plan is available on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis/Accessibility/Windows">wiki</a>.</p>

<p>My hope is that I&rsquo;ll be able to deliver a working, &ldquo;version 0.9&rdquo; type of demo
in time for our London all-hands at the end of Q2. Hopefully we will be able to
deliver on that!</p>

<h2>Some Additional Notes</h2>

<p>I am using this section of the blog post to make some additional notes. I don&rsquo;t
feel that these ideas are strong enough to commit to a wiki yet, but I do want
them to be publicly available.</p>

<p>Once concern that our colleagues at NVAccess have identified is that the
current COM interfaces are too chatty; this is a major reason why screen
readers frequently inject libraries into the Firefox address space. If we serve
our content a11y objects as remote COM objects, there is concern that performance
would suffer. This concern is not due to latency, but rather due to frequency
of calls; one function call does not provide sufficient information to the a11y
client. As a result, multiple round trips are required to fetch all of the
information that is required for a particular DOM node.</p>

<p>My gut feeling about this is that this is probably a legitimate concern, however
we cannot make good decisions without quantifying the performance. My plan going
forward is to proceed with a na&iuml;ve implementation of COM remoting to start,
followed by work on reducing round trips as necessary.</p>

<h2>Smart Proxies</h2>

<p>One idea that was discussed is the idea of the content process speculatively
sending information to the chrome process that might be needed in the future.
For example, if we have an <code>IAccessible</code>, we can expect that multiple properties
will be queried off that interface. A smart proxy could ship that data across
the RPC channel during marshaling so that querying that additional information
does not require additional round trips.</p>

<p>COM makes this possible using &ldquo;handler marshaling.&rdquo; I have dug up some
information about how to do this and am posting it here for posterity:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As of today I have added a new command to <code>mozdbgext</code>: <code>!iat</code>.</p>

<p>The syntax is pretty simple:</p>

<p><code>!iat &lt;hexadecimal address&gt;</code></p>

<p>This address shouldn&rsquo;t be just any pointer; it should be the address of an
entry in the current module&rsquo;s import address table (IAT). These addresses
are typically very identifiable by the <code>_imp_</code> prefix in their symbol names.</p>

<p>The purpose of this extension is to look up the name of the DLL from whom the
function is being imported. Furthermore, the extension checks the expected
target address of the import with the actual target address of the import. This
allows us to detect API hooking via IAT patching.</p>

<h3>An Example Session</h3>

<p>I fired up a local copy of Nightly, attached a debugger to it, and dumped the
call stack of its main thread:</p>

19 0018facc 00000000 ntdll!_RtlUserThreadStart+0x1b
</samp></pre>


<p>Let us examine the code at frame 3:</p>

<pre><samp>
14069042 6a04            push    4
14069044 68ff1d0000      push    1DFFh
14069049 8b5508          mov     edx,dword ptr [ebp+8]
1406904c 2b55f8          sub     edx,dword ptr [ebp-8]
1406904f 52              push    edx
14069050 6a00            push    0
14069052 6a00            push    0
14069054 ff159cc57d19    call    dword ptr [xul!_imp__MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx (197dc59c)]
1406905a 8945f4          mov     dword ptr [ebp-0Ch],eax
</samp></pre>


<p>Notice the function call to <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx</code> occurs indirectly;
the call instruction is referencing a pointer within the <code>xul.dll</code> binary
itself. This is the IAT entry that corresponds to that function.</p>

<p>Now, if I load <code>mozdbgext</code>, I can take the address of that IAT entry and execute
the following command:</p>

<pre><samp>
0:000> !iat 0x197dc59c
Expected target: USER32.dll!MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx
Actual target: USER32!MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx+0x0
</samp></pre>


<p><code>!iat</code> has done two things for us:</p>

<ol>
<li>It did a reverse lookup to determine the module and function name for the
import that corresponds to that particular IAT entry; and</li>
<li>It followed the IAT pointer and determined the symbol at the target address.</li>
</ol>


<p>Normally we want both the expected and actual targets to match. If they don&rsquo;t,
we should investigate further, as this mismatch may indicate that the IAT has
been patched by a third party.</p>

<p>Note that <code>!iat</code> command is breakpad aware (provided that you&rsquo;ve already
loaded the symbols using <code>!bploadsyms</code>) but can fall back to the Microsoft
symbol engine as necessary.</p>

<p>Further note that the <code>!iat</code> command does not yet accept the <code>_imp_</code> symbolic
names for the IAT entries, you need to enter the hexadecimal representation of
the pointer.</p>

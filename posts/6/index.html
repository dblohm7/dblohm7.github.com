  <div class="entry-content"><p>There has been enough that has been said over the past week about <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/08/21/the-future-of-developing-firefox-add-ons/">WebExtensions</a>
that I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I wanted to write this post. As usual, I can&rsquo;t seem to
help myself. Note the usual disclaimer that this is my personal opinion. Further
note that I have no involvement with WebExtensions at this time, so I write this
from the point of view of an observer.</p>

<h2>API? What API?</h2>

<p>I shall begin with the proposition that the legacy, non-jetpack
environment for addons is not an API. As ridiculous as some readers might
consider this to be, please humour me for a moment.</p>

<p>Let us go back to the acronym, &ldquo;API.&rdquo; <strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>I</strong>nterface.
While the usage of the term &ldquo;API&rdquo; seems to have expanded over the years to encompass
just about any type of interface whatsoever, I&rsquo;d like to explore the first letter of that
acronym: <em>Application</em>.</p>

<p>An <em>Application</em> Programming Interface is a specific type of interface that is
exposed for the purposes of building applications. It typically provides a
formal abstraction layer that isolates applications from the implementation
details behind the lower tier(s) in the software stack. In the case of web
browsers, I suggest that there are two distinct types of applications:
web content, and extensions.</p>

<p>There is obviously a very well defined API for web content. On the other hand,
I would argue that Gecko&rsquo;s legacy addon environment is not an API at all! From
the point of view of an extension, there is no abstraction, limited formality,
and not necessarily an intention to be used by applications.</p>

<p>An extension is imported into Firefox with full privileges and can access whatever
it wants. Does it have access to interfaces? Yes, but are those interfaces intended
for <em>applications</em>? Some are, but many are not. The environment that Gecko
currently provides for legacy addons is analagous to an operating system running
every single application in kernel mode. Is that powerful? Absolutely! Is that
the best thing to do for maintainability and robustness? Absolutely not!</p>

<p>Somewhere a line needs to be drawn to demarcate this abstraction layer and
improve Gecko developers&#8217; ability to make improvements under the hood. Last
week&rsquo;s announcement was an invitation to addon developers to help shape that
future. Please participate and please do so constructively!</p>

<h2>WebExtensions are not Chrome Extensions</h2>

<p>When I first heard rumors about WebExtensions in Whistler, my source made it
very clear to me that the WebExtensions initiative is not about making Chrome
extensions run in Firefox. In fact, I am quite disappointed with some of the
press coverage that seems to completely miss this point.</p>

<p>Yes, WebExtensions will be implementing some APIs to be <em>source compatible</em>
with Chrome. That makes it easier to port a Chrome extension, but porting will
still be necessary. I like the Venn Diagram concept that the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions/FAQ">WebExtensions FAQ</a>
uses: Some Chrome APIs will not be available in WebExtensions. On the other hand,
WebExtensions will be providing APIs above and beyond the Chrome API set that
will maintain Firefox&rsquo;s legacy of extensibility.</p>

<p>Please try not to think of this project as Mozilla taking functionality away.
In general I think it is safe to think of this as an opportunity to move that
same functionality to a mechanism that is more formal and abstract.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I decided to diff the export tables of some core Win32 DLLs to see what&rsquo;s
changed between Windows 8.1 and the Windows 10 technical preview. There weren&rsquo;t
many changes, but the ones that were there are quite exciting IMHO. While
researching these new APIs, I also stumbled across some others that were
added during the Windows 8 timeframe that we should be considering as well.</p>

<h2>Volatile Ranges</h2>

<p>While my diff showed these APIs as new exports for Windows 10, the MSDN docs
claim that these APIs are actually new for the Windows 8.1 Update. Using the
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn781436%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>OfferVirtualMemory</code></a>
and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn781437%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>ReclaimVirtualMemory</code></a>
functions, we can now specify ranges of virtual memory that are safe to
discarded under memory pressure. Later on, should we request that access be
restored to that memory, the kernel will either return that virtual memory to us
unmodified, or advise us that the associated pages have been discarded.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago we had an intern on the Perf Team who was working on
bringing this capability to Linux. I am pleasantly surprised that this is now
offered on Windows.</p>

<h2><code>madvise(MADV_WILLNEED)</code> for Win32</h2>

<p>For the longest time we have been hacking around the absence of a <code>madvise</code>-like
API on Win32. On Linux we will do a <code>madvise(MADV_WILLNEED)</code> on memory-mapped
files when we want the kernel to read ahead. On Win32, we were opening the
backing file and then doing a series of sequential reads through the file to
force the kernel to cache the file data. As of Windows 8, we can now call
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh780543%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>PrefetchVirtualMemory</code></a>
for a similar effect.</p>

<h2>Operation Recorder: An API for SuperFetch</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh437562%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>OperationStart</code></a>
and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh437558%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>OperationEnd</code></a>
APIs are intended to record access patterns during a file I/O operation.
SuperFetch will then create prefetch files for the operation, enabling prefetch
capabilities above and beyond the use case of initial process startup.</p>

<h2>Memory Pressure Notifications</h2>

<p>This API is not actually new, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any invocations of it in the
Mozilla codebase. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366541%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>CreateMemoryResourceNotification</code></a>
allocates a kernel handle that becomes signalled when physical memory is running
low. Gecko already has facilities for handling memory pressure events on other
platforms, so we should probably add this to the Win32 port.</p>

<p>This code is wrong. <strong>Very</strong> wrong.</p>

<p>Let us start with the calls to <code>GetQueueStatus</code> and <code>PeekMessage</code>. Those APIs
mark any messages already in the thread&rsquo;s message queue as having been seen,
such that they are no longer considered &ldquo;new.&rdquo; Even though those function calls
do not remove messages from the queue, any messages that were in the queue at
this point are considered to be &ldquo;old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The logic in this code snippet is essentially saying, &ldquo;if the queue contains
mouse messages that do not belong to this thread, then they must belong to an
attached thread.&rdquo; The code then calls <code>WaitMessage</code> in an effort to give the
other thread(s) a chance to process their mouse messages. This is where the code
goes off the rails.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644956%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">documentation</a>
for <code>WaitMessage</code> states the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>Note that <code>WaitMessage</code> does not return if there is unread input in the message
queue after the thread has called a function to check the queue. This is
because functions such as <code>PeekMessage</code>, <code>GetMessage</code>, <code>GetQueueStatus</code>,
<code>WaitMessage</code>, <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</code>, and <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx</code>
check the queue and then change the state information for the queue so that
the input is no longer considered new. A subsequent call to <code>WaitMessage</code> will
not return until new input of the specified type arrives. The existing unread
input (received prior to the last time the thread checked the queue) is ignored.</p></blockquote>

<p><code>WaitMessage</code> will only return if there is <em>a new</em> (as opposed to <em>any</em>) message
in the queue for the calling thread. Any messages for the calling thread that
were already in there at the time of the <code>GetQueueStatus</code> and <code>PeekMessage</code> calls
are no longer new, so they are ignored.</p>

<p>There might very well be a message at the head of that queue that should be
processed by the current thread. Instead it is ignored while we wait for other
threads. Here is the crux of the problem: we&rsquo;re waiting on other threads whose
input queues are attached to our own! That other thread can&rsquo;t process its
messages because our thread has messages in front of its messages; on the other
hand, our thread has blocked itself!</p>

<p>The only way to break this deadlock is for new messages to be added to the queue.
That is a big reason why we&rsquo;re seeing things like <a title="Page doesn't load/render if the mouse is not moving" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1105386">bug 1105386</a>: Moving the
mouse adds new messages to the queue, making <code>WaitMessage</code> unblock.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already eliminated this code in Mozilla&rsquo;s codebase, but the challenge is
going to be getting rid of this code in third-party binaries that attach their
own windows to Firefox&rsquo;s windows.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m finally getting &lsquo;round to writing about a nasty bug that I had to spend a
bunch of time with in Q4 2015. It&rsquo;s one of the more challenging problems that
I&rsquo;ve had to break and I&rsquo;ve been asked a lot of questions about it. I&rsquo;m talking
about <a title="Crash spike in CreateWindowEx with Firefox 42.0b9 on Optimus" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1218473">bug 1218473</a>.</p>

<h2>How This All Began</h2>

<p>In <a title="crash in mozilla::widget::TSFStaticSink::EnsureInitActiveTIPKeyboard()" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1213567">bug 1213567</a> I had landed a patch to intercept calls to <code>CreateWindowEx</code>.
This was necessary because it was apparent in that bug that window subclassing
was occurring while a window was neutered (&ldquo;neutering&rdquo; is terminology that is
specific to Mozilla&rsquo;s Win32 IPC code).</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;ll save a discussion on the specifics of window neutering for another
day, for our purposes it is sufficient for me to point out that subclassing a
neutered window is bad because it creates an infinite recursion scenario with
window procedures that will eventually overflow the stack.</p>

<p>Neutering is triggered during certain types of IPC calls as soon as a message is
sent to an unneutered window on the thread making the IPC call. Unfortunately in
the case of <a title="crash in mozilla::widget::TSFStaticSink::EnsureInitActiveTIPKeyboard()" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1213567">bug 1213567</a>, the message triggering the neutering was
<code>WM_CREATE</code>. Shortly after creating that window, the code responsible would
subclass said window. Since <code>WM_CREATE</code> had already triggered neutering, this
would result in the pathological case that triggers the stack overflow.</p>

<p>For a fix, what I wanted to do is to prevent messages that were sent immediately
during the execution of <code>CreateWindow</code> (such as <code>WM_CREATE</code>) from triggering
neutering prematurely. By intercepting calls to <code>CreateWindowEx</code>, I could wrap
those calls with a RAII object that temporarily suppresses the neutering. Since
the subclassing occurs immediately after window creation, this meant that
this subclassing operation was now safe.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, shortly after landing <a title="crash in mozilla::widget::TSFStaticSink::EnsureInitActiveTIPKeyboard()" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1213567">bug 1213567</a>, <a title="Crash spike in CreateWindowEx with Firefox 42.0b9 on Optimus" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1218473">bug 1218473</a> was filed.</p>

<h2>Where to Start</h2>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t obvious where to start debugging this. While a crash spike was clearly
correlated with the landing of <a title="crash in mozilla::widget::TSFStaticSink::EnsureInitActiveTIPKeyboard()" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1213567">bug 1213567</a>, the crashes were occurring in
code that had nothing to do with IPC or Win32. For example, the first stack that
I looked at was <code>js::CreateRegExpMatchResult</code>!</p>

<p>When it is just not clear where to begin, I like to start by looking at our
correlation data in Socorro &ndash; you&rsquo;d be surprised how often they can bring
problems into sharp relief!</p>

<p>In this case, the correlation data didn&rsquo;t disappoint: there
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1218473#c10">was</a> 100% correlation
with a module called <code>_etoured.dll</code>. There was also correlation with the
presence of both NVIDIA video drivers <em>and</em> Intel video drivers. Clearly this
was a concern only when NVIDIA Optimus technology was enabled.</p>

<p>I also had a pretty strong hypothesis about what <code>_etoured.dll</code> was: For many
years, Microsoft Research has shipped a package called
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/detours/">Detours</a>. Detours is a
library that is used for intercepting Win32 API calls. While the changelog for
Detours 3.0 points out that it has &ldquo;Removed [the] requirement for including
<code>detoured.dll</code> in processes,&rdquo; in previous versions of the package, this library
was required to be injected into the target process.</p>

<p>I concluded that <code>_etoured.dll</code> was most likely a renamed version of
<code>detoured.dll</code> from Detours 2.x.</p>

<h2>Following The Trail</h2>

<p>Now that I knew the likely culprit, I needed to know how it was getting there.
During a November trip to the Mozilla Toronto office, I spent some time
debugging a test laptop that was configured with Optimus.</p>

<p>Knowing that the presence of Detours was somehow interfering with our own API
interception, I decided to find out whether it was also trying to intercept
<code>CreateWindowExW</code>. I launched <code>windbg</code>, started Firefox with it, and then told
it to break as soon as <code>user32.dll</code> was loaded:</p>

<pre><samp>
sxe ld:user32.dll
</samp></pre>


<p>Then I pressed <code>F5</code> to resume execution. When the debugger broke again, this
time <code>user32</code> was now in memory. I wanted the debugger to break as soon as
<code>CreateWindowExW</code> was touched:</p>

<pre><samp>
ba w 4 user32!CreateWindowExW
</samp></pre>


<p>Once again I resumed execution. Then the debugger broke on the memory access and
gave me this call stack:</p>

<pre><samp>

<p>This stack is a gold mine of information. In particular, it tells us the
following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The offending DLLs are being injected by <code>AppInit_DLLs</code> (and in fact, Raymond
Chen <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140422-00/?p=1173">has blogged about</a>
this exact case in the past).</p></li>
<li><p><code>nvinit.dll</code> is the name of the DLL that is injected by step 1.</p></li>
<li><p><code>nvinit.dll</code> loads <code>nvd3d9wrap.dll</code> which then uses Detours to patch
our copy of <code>CreateWindowExW</code>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I then became curious as to which other functions they were patching.</p>

<p>Since Detours is patching executable code, we know that at some point it is
going to need to call <code>VirtualProtect</code> to make the target code writable. In the
worst case, <code>VirtualProtect</code>&rsquo;s caller is going to pass the address of the page
where the target code resides. In the best case, the caller will pass in the
address of the target function itself!</p>

<p>I restarted <code>windbg</code>, but this time I set a breakpoint on <code>VirtualProtect</code>:</p>

<pre><samp>
bp kernel32!VirtualProtect
</samp></pre>


<p>I then resumed the debugger and examined the call stack every time it broke.
While not every single <code>VirtualProtect</code> call would correspond to a detour, it
would be obvious when it was, as the NVIDIA DLLs would be on the call stack.</p>

<p>The first time I caught a detour, I examined the address being passed to
<code>VirtualProtect</code>: I ended up with the best possible case: the address was
pointing to the actual target function! From there I was able to distill a
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1218473#c39">list</a> of other
functions being hooked by the injected NVIDIA DLLs.</p>

<h2>Putting it all Together</h2>

<p>By this point I knew who was hooking our code and knew how it was getting there.
I also noticed that <code>CreateWindowEx</code> is the only function that the NVIDIA DLLs
and our own code were both trying to intercept. Clearly there was some kind of
bad interaction occurring between the two interception mechanisms, but what was
it?</p>

<p>I decided to go back and examine a
<a href="https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/e884dc17-957f-4270-86ab-f59742151113">specific</a>
crash dump. In particular, I wanted to examine three different memory locations:</p>

<ol>
<li>The first few instructions of <code>user32!CreateWindowExW</code>;</li>
<li>The first few instructions of <code>xul!CreateWindowExWHook</code>; and</li>
<li>The site of the call to <code>user32!CreateWindowExW</code> that triggered the crash.</li>
</ol>


<p>Of those three locations, the only one that looked off was location 2:</p>

<pre><samp>
6b1f6611 56              push    esi
6b1f6612 ff15f033e975    call    dword ptr [combase!CClassCache::CLSvrClassEntry::GetDDEInfo+0x41 (75e933f0)]
6b1f6618 c3              ret
6b1f6619 7106            jno     xul!`anonymous namespace'::CreateWindowExWHook+0x6 (6b1f6621)
xul!`anonymous namespace'::CreateWindowExWHook:
6b1f661b cc              int     3
6b1f661c cc              int     3
6b1f661d cc              int     3
6b1f661e cc              int     3
6b1f661f cc              int     3
6b1f6620 cc              int     3
6b1f6621 ff              ???
</samp></pre>


<p><em>Why the hell were the first six bytes filled with breakpoint instructions?</em></p>

<p>I decided at this point to look at some source code. Fortunately Microsoft
publishes the 32-bit source code for Detours, licensed for non-profit use,
under the name &ldquo;Detours Express.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I found a copy of Detours Express 2.1 and checked out the code. First I wanted
to know where all of these <code>0xcc</code> bytes were coming from. A quick <code>grep</code> turned
up what I was looking for:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>detours.cpp</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>93</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now that I knew which function was generating the <code>int 3</code> instructions, I then
wanted to find its callers. Soon I found:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>detours.cpp</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1247</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Okay, so Detours writes the breakpoints out immediately after it has written a
<code>jmp</code> pointing to its trampoline.</p>

<p><em>Why is our hook function being trampolined?</em></p>

<p>The reason must be because our hook was installed first! Detours has
detected that and has decided that the best place to trampoline to the NVIDIA
hook is at the beginning of our hook function.</p>

<p><em>But Detours is using the wrong address!</em></p>

<p>We can see that because the <code>int 3</code> instructions are written out at the
<em>beginning</em> of <code>CreateWindowExWHook</code>, even though there should be a <code>jmp</code>
instruction first.</p>

<p><strong>Detours is calculating the wrong address to write its <code>jmp</code>!</strong></p>

<h2>Finding a Workaround</h2>

<p>Once I knew <em>what</em> the problem was, I needed to know more about the <em>why</em> &ndash;
only then would I be able to come up with a way to work around this problem.</p>

<p>I decided to reconstruct the scenario where both our code and Detours are trying
to hook the same function, but our hook was installed first. I would then
follow along through the Detours code to determine how it calculated the wrong
address to install its <code>jmp</code>.</p>

<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that Mozilla&rsquo;s function interception code
takes advantage of <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110921-00/?p=9583">hot-patch points</a>
in Windows. If the target function begins with a <code>mov edi, edi</code> prolog, we
use a hot-patch style hook instead of a trampoline hook. I am not going to go
into detail about hot-patch hooks here &ndash; the above Raymond Chen link contains
enough details to answer your questions. For the purposes of this blog post, the
important point is that Mozilla&rsquo;s code patches the <code>mov edi, edi</code>, so NVIDIA&rsquo;s
Detours library would need to recognize and follow the <code>jmp</code>s that our code
patched in, in order to write its own <code>jmp</code> at <code>CreateWindowExWHook</code>.</p>

<p>Tracing through the Detours code, I found the place where it checks for a
hot-patch hook and follows the <code>jmp</code> if necessary. While examining a function
called <code>detour_skip_jmp</code>, I found the bug:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>detours.cpp</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>124</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c++'><span class='line'>        <span class="n">pbNew</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pbCode</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">INT32</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">pbCode</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This code is supposed to be telling Detours where the target address of a <code>jmp</code>
is, so that Detours can follow it. <code>pbNew</code> is supposed to be the target address
of the <code>jmp</code>. <code>pbCode</code> is referencing the address <em>of the beginning of the <code>jmp</code>
instruction itself</em>. Unfortunately, with this type of <code>jmp</code> instruction, target
addresses are always relative to the address of the <em>next</em> instruction, not
the <em>current</em> instruction! Since the current <code>jmp</code> instruction is five bytes
long, Detours ends up writing its <code>jmp</code> <em>five bytes prior</em> to the intended
target address!</p>

<p>I went and checked the source code for Detours Express 3.0 to see if this had
been fixed, and indeed it had:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>detours.cpp</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>163</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c++'><span class='line'>        <span class="n">PBYTE</span> <span class="n">pbNew</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pbCode</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">INT32</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">pbCode</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That doesn&rsquo;t do much for me right now, however, since the NVIDIA stuff is still
using Detours 2.x.</p>

<p>In the case of Mozilla&rsquo;s code, there is legitimate executable code at that
incorrect address that Detours writes to. It is corrupting the last few
instructions of that function, thus explaining those mysterious crashes that
were seemingly unrelated code.</p>

<p>I confirmed this by downloading the binaries from the build that was associated
with the crash dump that I was analyzing. [As an aside, I should point out that
you need to grab the <em>identical</em> binaries for this exercise; you cannot build
from the same source revision and expect this to work due to variability that
is introduced into builds by things like PGO.]</p>

<p>The five bytes preceeding <code>CreateWindowExHookW</code> in the crash dump diverged from
those same bytes in the original binaries. I could also make out that the
overwritten bytes consisted of a <code>jmp</code> instruction.</p>

<h3>In Summary</h3>

<p>Let us now review what we know at this point:</p>

<ul>
<li>Detours 2.x doesn&rsquo;t correctly follow <code>jmp</code>s from hot-patch hooks;</li>
<li>If Detours tries to hook something that has already been hot-patched
(including legitimate hot patches from Microsoft), it will write bytes at
incorrect addresses;</li>
<li>NVIDIA Optimus injects this buggy code into everybody&rsquo;s address spaces via an
<code>AppInit_DLLs</code> entry for <code>nvinit.dll</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>How can we best distill this into a suitable workaround?</p>

<p>One option could be to block the NVIDIA DLLs outright. In most cases this would
probably be the simplest option, but I was hesitant to do so this time. I was
concerned about the unintended consequences of blocking what, for better or
worse, is a user-mode component of NVIDIA video drivers.</p>

<p>Instead I decided to take advantage of the fact that we now know how this bug is
triggered. I have modified our API interception code such that if it detects
the presence of NVIDIA Optimus, it disables hot-patch style hooks.</p>

<p>Not only will this take care of the crash spike that started when I landed
<a title="crash in mozilla::widget::TSFStaticSink::EnsureInitActiveTIPKeyboard()" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1213567">bug 1213567</a>, I also expect it to take care of other crash signatures
whose relationship to this bug was not obvious.</p>

<p>That concludes this episode of <em>Bugs from Hell</em>. Until next time&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There has been enough that has been said over the past week about <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/08/21/the-future-of-developing-firefox-add-ons/">WebExtensions</a>
that I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I wanted to write this post. As usual, I can&rsquo;t seem to
help myself. Note the usual disclaimer that this is my personal opinion. Further
note that I have no involvement with WebExtensions at this time, so I write this
from the point of view of an observer.</p>

<h2>API? What API?</h2>

<p>I shall begin with the proposition that the legacy, non-jetpack
environment for addons is not an API. As ridiculous as some readers might
consider this to be, please humour me for a moment.</p>

<p>Let us go back to the acronym, &ldquo;API.&rdquo; <strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>I</strong>nterface.
While the usage of the term &ldquo;API&rdquo; seems to have expanded over the years to encompass
just about any type of interface whatsoever, I&rsquo;d like to explore the first letter of that
acronym: <em>Application</em>.</p>

<p>An <em>Application</em> Programming Interface is a specific type of interface that is
exposed for the purposes of building applications. It typically provides a
formal abstraction layer that isolates applications from the implementation
details behind the lower tier(s) in the software stack. In the case of web
browsers, I suggest that there are two distinct types of applications:
web content, and extensions.</p>

<p>There is obviously a very well defined API for web content. On the other hand,
I would argue that Gecko&rsquo;s legacy addon environment is not an API at all! From
the point of view of an extension, there is no abstraction, limited formality,
and not necessarily an intention to be used by applications.</p>

<p>An extension is imported into Firefox with full privileges and can access whatever
it wants. Does it have access to interfaces? Yes, but are those interfaces intended
for <em>applications</em>? Some are, but many are not. The environment that Gecko
currently provides for legacy addons is analagous to an operating system running
every single application in kernel mode. Is that powerful? Absolutely! Is that
the best thing to do for maintainability and robustness? Absolutely not!</p>

<p>Somewhere a line needs to be drawn to demarcate this abstraction layer and
improve Gecko developers&#8217; ability to make improvements under the hood. Last
week&rsquo;s announcement was an invitation to addon developers to help shape that
future. Please participate and please do so constructively!</p>

<h2>WebExtensions are not Chrome Extensions</h2>

<p>When I first heard rumors about WebExtensions in Whistler, my source made it
very clear to me that the WebExtensions initiative is not about making Chrome
extensions run in Firefox. In fact, I am quite disappointed with some of the
press coverage that seems to completely miss this point.</p>

<p>Yes, WebExtensions will be implementing some APIs to be <em>source compatible</em>
with Chrome. That makes it easier to port a Chrome extension, but porting will
still be necessary. I like the Venn Diagram concept that the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions/FAQ">WebExtensions FAQ</a>
uses: Some Chrome APIs will not be available in WebExtensions. On the other hand,
WebExtensions will be providing APIs above and beyond the Chrome API set that
will maintain Firefox&rsquo;s legacy of extensibility.</p>

<p>Please try not to think of this project as Mozilla taking functionality away.
In general I think it is safe to think of this as an opportunity to move that
same functionality to a mechanism that is more formal and abstract.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I decided to diff the export tables of some core Win32 DLLs to see what&rsquo;s
changed between Windows 8.1 and the Windows 10 technical preview. There weren&rsquo;t
many changes, but the ones that were there are quite exciting IMHO. While
researching these new APIs, I also stumbled across some others that were
added during the Windows 8 timeframe that we should be considering as well.</p>

<h2>Volatile Ranges</h2>

<p>While my diff showed these APIs as new exports for Windows 10, the MSDN docs
claim that these APIs are actually new for the Windows 8.1 Update. Using the
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn781436%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>OfferVirtualMemory</code></a>
and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn781437%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>ReclaimVirtualMemory</code></a>
functions, we can now specify ranges of virtual memory that are safe to
discarded under memory pressure. Later on, should we request that access be
restored to that memory, the kernel will either return that virtual memory to us
unmodified, or advise us that the associated pages have been discarded.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago we had an intern on the Perf Team who was working on
bringing this capability to Linux. I am pleasantly surprised that this is now
offered on Windows.</p>

<h2><code>madvise(MADV_WILLNEED)</code> for Win32</h2>

<p>For the longest time we have been hacking around the absence of a <code>madvise</code>-like
API on Win32. On Linux we will do a <code>madvise(MADV_WILLNEED)</code> on memory-mapped
files when we want the kernel to read ahead. On Win32, we were opening the
backing file and then doing a series of sequential reads through the file to
force the kernel to cache the file data. As of Windows 8, we can now call
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh780543%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>PrefetchVirtualMemory</code></a>
for a similar effect.</p>

<h2>Operation Recorder: An API for SuperFetch</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh437562%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>OperationStart</code></a>
and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh437558%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>OperationEnd</code></a>
APIs are intended to record access patterns during a file I/O operation.
SuperFetch will then create prefetch files for the operation, enabling prefetch
capabilities above and beyond the use case of initial process startup.</p>

<h2>Memory Pressure Notifications</h2>

<p>This API is not actually new, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any invocations of it in the
Mozilla codebase. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366541%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>CreateMemoryResourceNotification</code></a>
allocates a kernel handle that becomes signalled when physical memory is running
low. Gecko already has facilities for handling memory pressure events on other
platforms, so we should probably add this to the Win32 port.</p>

<p>This code is wrong. <strong>Very</strong> wrong.</p>

<p>Let us start with the calls to <code>GetQueueStatus</code> and <code>PeekMessage</code>. Those APIs
mark any messages already in the thread&rsquo;s message queue as having been seen,
such that they are no longer considered &ldquo;new.&rdquo; Even though those function calls
do not remove messages from the queue, any messages that were in the queue at
this point are considered to be &ldquo;old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The logic in this code snippet is essentially saying, &ldquo;if the queue contains
mouse messages that do not belong to this thread, then they must belong to an
attached thread.&rdquo; The code then calls <code>WaitMessage</code> in an effort to give the
other thread(s) a chance to process their mouse messages. This is where the code
goes off the rails.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644956%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">documentation</a>
for <code>WaitMessage</code> states the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>Note that <code>WaitMessage</code> does not return if there is unread input in the message
queue after the thread has called a function to check the queue. This is
because functions such as <code>PeekMessage</code>, <code>GetMessage</code>, <code>GetQueueStatus</code>,
<code>WaitMessage</code>, <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</code>, and <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx</code>
check the queue and then change the state information for the queue so that
the input is no longer considered new. A subsequent call to <code>WaitMessage</code> will
not return until new input of the specified type arrives. The existing unread
input (received prior to the last time the thread checked the queue) is ignored.</p></blockquote>

<p><code>WaitMessage</code> will only return if there is <em>a new</em> (as opposed to <em>any</em>) message
in the queue for the calling thread. Any messages for the calling thread that
were already in there at the time of the <code>GetQueueStatus</code> and <code>PeekMessage</code> calls
are no longer new, so they are ignored.</p>

<p>There might very well be a message at the head of that queue that should be
processed by the current thread. Instead it is ignored while we wait for other
threads. Here is the crux of the problem: we&rsquo;re waiting on other threads whose
input queues are attached to our own! That other thread can&rsquo;t process its
messages because our thread has messages in front of its messages; on the other
hand, our thread has blocked itself!</p>

<p>The only way to break this deadlock is for new messages to be added to the queue.
That is a big reason why we&rsquo;re seeing things like <a title="Page doesn't load/render if the mouse is not moving" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1105386">bug 1105386</a>: Moving the
mouse adds new messages to the queue, making <code>WaitMessage</code> unblock.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already eliminated this code in Mozilla&rsquo;s codebase, but the challenge is
going to be getting rid of this code in third-party binaries that attach their
own windows to Firefox&rsquo;s windows.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://dblohm7.ca/blog/2012/11/22/plugin-hang-user-interface-for-firefox/">previously</a> <a href="https://dblohm7.ca/blog/2013/02/15/plugin-hang-ui-on-aurora/">blogged</a>
indirectly about attached input queues, but today I want to address the issue directly. What once was a nuisance in the realm of plugin hangs has grown into a more
serious problem in the land of OMTC and e10s.</p>

<p>As a brief recap for those who are not very familiar with this problem: imagine two windows, each on their own separate threads, forming a parent-child relationship
with each other. When this situation arises, Windows implicitly attaches together and synchronizes their input queues, putting each thread at the mercy of the other
attached threads&#8217; ability to pump messages. If one thread does something bad in its message pump, any other threads that are attached to it are likely to be affected as well.</p>

<p>One of the biggest annoyances when it comes to knowledge about which threads are affected, is that we are essentially flying blind. There is no
way to query Windows for information about attached input queues. This is unfortunate, as it would be really nice to obtain some specific knowledge to allow us to
analyze the state of Firefox threads&#8217; input queues so that we can mitigate the problem.</p>

<p>I had previously been working on a personal side project to make this possible, but in light of recent developments (and a <a href="https://twitter.com/nsIAnswers/status/565883284748795905">tweet from bsmedberg</a>),
I decided to bring this investigation under the umbrella of my full-time job. I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that I&rsquo;ve finished the first cut of a utility that I call
the Input Queue Visualizer, or <code>iqvis</code>.</p>

<p><code>iqvis</code> consists of two components, one of which is a kernel-mode driver. This driver exposes input queue attachment data to user mode. The <code>iqvis</code> user-mode
executable is the client that queries the driver and outputs the results. In the next section I&rsquo;m going to discuss the inner workings of <code>iqvis</code>. Following that, I&rsquo;ll
discuss the <a href="#results">results</a> of running <code>iqvis</code> on an instance of Firefox.</p>

<h2><a name="internals"></a>Input Queue Visualizer Internals</h2>

<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s start off with this caveat: <strong>Nearly everything that this driver does involves undocumented APIs and data structures</strong>. Because of this, <code>iqvis</code>
does some things that you should never do in production software.</p>

<p>One of the big consequences of using undocumented information is that <code>iqvis</code> requires pointers to very specific locations
in kernel memory to accomplish things. These pointers will change every time that Windows is updated. To mitigate this, I kind of cheated: it turns out that
debugging symbols exist for all of the locations that <code>iqvis</code> needs to access! I wrote the <code>iqvis</code> client to invoke the <code>dbghelp</code> engine to extract the pointers that
I need from Windows symbols and send those values as the input to the <code>DeviceIoControl</code> call that triggers the data collection. Passing pointers from user mode to be
accessed in kernel mode is a very dangerous thing to do (and again, I would never do it in production software), but it is damn convenient for <code>iqvis</code>!</p>

<p>Another issue is that these undocumented details change between Windows versions. The initial version of <code>iqvis</code> works on 64-bit Windows 8.1, but different code is required
for other major releases, such as Windows 7. The <code>iqvis</code> driver theoretically will work on Windows 7 but I need to make a few bug fixes for that case.</p>

<p>So, getting those details out of the way, we can address the crux of the problem: we need to query input queue attachment information from <code>win32k.sys</code>, which is the
driver that implements USER and GDI system calls on Windows NT systems.</p>

<p>In particular, the window manager maintains a linked list that describes thread attachment info as a triple that points to the &ldquo;from&rdquo; thread, the &ldquo;to&rdquo; thread, and a count.
The count is necessary because the same two threads may be attached to each other multiple times. The <code>iqvis</code> driver walks this linked list in a thread-safe way to obtain
the attachment data, and then copies it to the output buffer for the <code>DeviceIoControl</code> request.</p>

<p>Since <code>iqvis</code> involves a device driver, and since I have not digitally signed that device driver, one can&rsquo;t just run <code>iqvis</code> and call it a day. This program won&rsquo;t work
unless the computer was either booted with kernel debugging enabled, or it was booted with driver signing temporarily disabled.</p>

<h2><a name="results"></a>Running <code>iqvis</code> against Firefox</h2>

<p>Today I ran <code>iqvis</code> using today&rsquo;s Nightly 39 as well as the lastest release of Flash. I also tried it with Flash Protected Mode both disabled and enabled.
(Note that these examples used an older version of <code>iqvis</code> that outputs thread IDs in hexadecimal. The current version uses decimal for its output.)</p>

<h3>Protected Mode Disabled</h3>

<pre><samp>FromTID ToTID Count
ac8 df4 1
</samp></pre>


<p>Looking up the thread IDs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>df4</code> is the Firefox main thread;</li>
<li><code>ac8</code> is the plugin-container main thread.</li>
</ul>


<p>I think that the output from this case is pretty much what I was expecting to see. The protected mode case, however, is more interesting.</p>

<h3>Protected Mode Enabled</h3>

<pre><samp>FromTID ToTID Count
f8c dbc 1
794 f8c 3
</samp></pre>


<p>Looking up the thread IDs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>dbc</code> is the Firefox main thread;</li>
<li><code>f8c</code> is the plugin-container main thread;</li>
<li><code>794</code> is the Flash sandbox main thread.</li>
</ul>


<p>Notice how Flash is attached to plugin-container, which is then attached to Firefox. Notice that transitively the Flash sandbox is effectively attached to Firefox,
confirming previous hypotheses that I&rsquo;ve discussed with colleagues in the past.</p>

<p>Also notice how the Flash sandbox attachment to plugin-container has a count of 3!</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>In my opinion, my Input Queue Visualizer has already yielded some very interesting data. Hopefully this will help us to troubleshoot our issues in the future. Oh,
and the code is up on <a href="https://github.com/dblohm7/iqvis">GitHub</a>! It&rsquo;s poorly documented at the moment, but just remember to only try running it on 64-bit Windows
8.1 for the time being!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today&rsquo;s <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org">Nightly 34</a> build includes the work I did
for <a title="Need win32 implementation of nsIProfileUnlocker" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=286355">bug 286355</a>: a profile unlocker for our Windows users. This should be very
helpful to those users whose workflow is interrupted by a Firefox instance that
cannot start because a previous Firefox instance has not finished shutting down.</p>

<p>Firefox 34 users running Windows Vista or newer will now be presented with this
dialog box:</p>

<p><a href="https://dblohm7.ca/images/profile-unlocker.png"><img src="https://dblohm7.ca/images/profile-unlocker.png"></a></p>

<p>Clicking &ldquo;Close Firefox&rdquo; will terminate that previous instance and proceed
with starting your new Firefox instance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this feature is not available to Windows XP users. To support this
feature on Windows XP we would need to call undocumented API functions. I
prefer to avoid calling undocumented APIs when writing production software due
to the potential stability and compatibility issues that can arise from doing
so.</p>

<p>While this feature adds some convenience to an otherwise annoying issue, please
be assured that the Desktop Performance Team will continue to investigate and
fix the root causes of long shutdowns so that a profile unlocker hopefully
becomes unnecessary.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something that I&rsquo;ve been noticing on numerous social media and discussion forum
sites is that whenever Firefox comes up, inevitably there are comments in those
threads about Firefox performance. Given my role at Mozilla, these comments are
of particular interest to me.</p>

<p>The reaction to roc&rsquo;s <a href="http://robert.ocallahan.org/2014/08/choose-firefox-now-or-later-you-wont.html">recent blog post</a>
has motivated me enough to respond to a specific subset of comments. These
comments all exhibit a certain pattern: their authors are experiencing problems
with Firefox, they are very dissatisfied, but they are not discussing them in a
way that is actionable by Mozilla.</p>

<h2>How Mozilla Finds Problems</h2>

<p>Mozilla encourages our contributors to run prerelease versions of Firefox,
especially <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org">Nightly</a> builds. This allows us to do
some good old-fashioned dogfooding during the development of a Firefox release.</p>

<p>We also have many tools that run as part of our continuous integration
infrastructure. Valgrind, Address Sanitizer, Leak Sanitizer, reference count
tracking, deadlock detection, assertions, Talos performance tests, and xperf are
some of the various tools that we apply to our builds. I do not claim that this
list is exhaustive! :-)</p>

<p>We use numerous technologies to discover problems that occur while running on
our users&#8217; computers. We have a crash reporter that (with the user&rsquo;s consent)
reports <a href="https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/home/products/Firefox">data</a> about the
crash. We have Firefox Health Report and <a href="http://telemetry.mozilla.org">Telemetry</a>
that, when consented to, send us useful information for discovering problems.</p>

<p>Our ability to analyze crash report/FHR/telemetry data is limited to those users
who consent to share it with us. As much as I am proud of the fact that we
respect the privacy of our users, this means that we only receive data from a
fraction of them; many users who are experiencing problems are not included in
this data.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that we have all of these wonderful tools to help us deliver
quality releases, the fact is that they cannot exhaustively catch every possible
bug that is encountered out in the wild. There are too many combinations of
extensions and configurations out there to possibly allow us to catch
everything before release.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where you, our users, come in!</p>

<h2>If You See Something, Say Something!</h2>

<p>Reddit, Hacker News, Slashdot and other similar sites are fantastic for ranting.
I should know &ndash; I do it with the best of them! Having said that, they are also
terrible for the purposes of bug reporting!</p>

<p>As users it&rsquo;s easy for us to assume that somebody else will encounter our
problems and report them. Unfortunately that is not always the case, especially
with a browser that is as configurable as Firefox.</p>

<h3>Reporting Bugs</h3>

<p>If you are experiencing a bug, the best way to ensure that something can be done
about your bug is to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=guided">report it</a>
in Bugzilla. This might seem a little bit intimidating for somebody who is new
to bug reporting, but I assure you, Mozillians are really nice! As long as you
follow the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html">etiquette guidelines</a>,
you&rsquo;ll be fine! One suggestion though: try to follow our
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines">bug writing guidelines</a>.
Doing so will maximize the likelihood of a contributor being able to reproduce
your problem. In addition to these suggestions for bug filing, I also suggest
including certain types of data for specific types of problems:</p>

<h3>Reporting a Bug for High Memory Usage</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re experiencing problems with Firefox&rsquo;s memory use, open a tab, and
point your browser to <code>about:memory</code>. This nifty feature provides a breakdown
of Firefox memory consumption. Save that report and attach it to the bug that
you&rsquo;ve filed.</p>

<h3>Reporting a Bug for Slowness or Heavy CPU Usage</h3>

<p>If you want report a problem with Firefox being slow and/or mysteriously
consuming large amounts of CPU time, the best way to help us is
is to include data that has been generated by the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/Profiling_with_the_Built-in_Profiler">Gecko Profiler</a>.
[<em>This data is referred to as a &ldquo;profile,&rdquo; but please do not confuse it with the
user profile that stores your settings and browser history &ndash; they are different
things with the same name.</em>] This tool tracks how Firefox uses your CPU over
time. If you are able to attach a profile that was taken during a period of time
where Firefox was running poorly, it will help us understand what exactly Firefox
was doing. Unfortunately this is tool requires a bit of technical savvy, but
attaching the URL of an uploaded profile to your performance bug can be very helpful.</p>

<h3>Reporting a Bug for a Persistent, Reproducable Crash</h3>

<p>As you can see in our <a href="https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/home/products/Firefox">crash report data</a>,
crashes reported to Mozilla are ranked by frequency. As you might expect, this
implies that it&rsquo;s often the squeaky wheels that get the grease.</p>

<p>If you have an easily reproducable crash and you are sending your reports to
Mozilla, you can help us by pointing Firefox to <code>about:crashes</code>. This page lists
all of the crash reports that have been generated on your computer. If the crash
that you are experiencing isn&rsquo;t on our list of top crashers, you can still help
us to fix it: filing a bug that includes multiple crash report URLs from your
<code>about:crashes</code> screen will help tremendously.</p>

<h3>Reporting a Bug for a Website that Looks Wrong in Firefox</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d suggest reporting your problem over at <a href="http://webcompat.com">webcompat.com</a>.
Volunteers will review your report and determine whether your problem is caused
by the website or by Firefox, and file a bug with the appropriate entity.</p>

<h3>I have a problem that isn&rsquo;t listed here. What should I do?</h3>

<p>Send us <a href="https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/feedback">feedback</a>!</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>If there is one idea that you can take away from this post (a TL;DR, if you will),
it is this: <em>Mozilla cannot fix 100% of the bugs that we do not know about.</em></p>

<p>Taking an active role in the Mozilla community by reporting your issues through
the proper channels is the best way to ensure that your problems can be fixed.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To be clear: What I am suggesting is that users who are enthusiastic
enough to post a comment to Hacker News (for example) should also be savvy
enough to be able to file a proper bug report. Please do not misconstrue this
post as a demand that novice users start filing bugs.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT August 15, 2014:</strong> Nick Nethercote just <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2014/08/15/the-story-of-a-tricky-bug/">blogged</a>
about a tricky memory bug that couldn&rsquo;t have been diagnosed without the help of
a Redditor whose complaint we steered to Bugzilla.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT August 23, 2014:</strong> Wow, this has blown up. More edits to update this post
with additional information in repose to some of the questions posted in the
comments. Thanks for reading!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have spent a lot of time this quarter working on <a title="Asynchronous Initialization of Out-of-process Plugins" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=998863">bug 998863</a>, &ldquo;Asynchronous
Initialization of Out-of-process Plugins.&rdquo; While the bug summary is fairly self
explanatory, I would like to provide some more details about why I am doing this
and what kind of work it entails. I would also like to wrap up the post with an
early demonstration of this feature and present some profiles to illustrate the
potential performance improvement.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>The reason that I am undertaking this project is because NPAPI plugin startup
is our most frequent cause of jank. In fact, at the time of this writing, our
<a href="http://telemetry.mozilla.org/chromehangs/">Chrome Hangs telemetry</a> is showing
that 4 out of our top 10 most frequent offending call stacks are related to
plugin initialization and instantiation. Furthermore, creating the
plugin-container.exe child process is the #1 most frequent chrome hang offender
(Note that our Chrome Hang telemetry consists entirely of Windows builds, where
process creation is quite expensive).</p>

<h2>A High-level Breakdown of NPAPI Initialization and Instantiation</h2>

<p>The typical steps involved can be broken down as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Launch the <code>plugin-container</code> process;</li>
<li>Call <code>NP_Initialize</code> to load the plugin;</li>
<li>Create instances by calling <code>NPP_New</code>;</li>
<li>Call <code>NPP_NewStream</code> for instances that load stream data;</li>
<li>If an instance is scriptable, call <code>NPP_GetValue</code> to obtain information
about the plugin&rsquo;s scriptable object.</li>
</ol>


<p>The patch that I am working on modifies steps 1 through 4 to run asynchronously.
Step 5 is a special case &ndash; we asynchronously return a proxy object, but if a
synchronous JS method is called on that object, we must wait for the plugin to
initialize (if it has not yet done so). My hope is that if we have to call a
synchronous JS method on the proxy object, plugin initialization will be far
enough along that the wait will be minimal.</p>

<h2>A Brief Demonstration</h2>

<p>The following video compares two locally-built Nightlies that are identical
except for the asynchronous initialization patch. After loading the browser
with a page containing several embedded Flash objects, we can profile and
observe the effects of this patch.</p>

<p>This patch requires some further work on scripting and stabilization. The
information in this post is subject to change. :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=867762">bug 867762</a> I am landing I/O
interpose facilities for SPS. This feature will allow main thread I/O to be
displayed in the profiler UI.</p>

<p>There are a few components to this patch. Classes that implement the
<code>IOInterposerModule</code> interface are responsible for hooking into an arbitrary I/O
facility and calling into <code>IOInterposer</code> with those events.</p>

<p>The <code>IOInterposer</code> receives those events and then dispatches them to any registered
observers. For the purposes of SPS there is only one observer,
<code>ProfilerIOInterposeObserver</code>, however I wrote this keeping in mind that we
may eventually want to use the I/O interpose facilities for other purposes (such
as shutdown write poisioning).</p>

<p>For bug 867762 I have implemented two modules. <code>NSPRInterposer</code> hooks into NSPR
file I/O and generates events whenever a <code>PR_Read</code>, <code>PR_Write</code>, or <code>PR_Sync</code> occurs.
The second module, <code>SQLiteInterposer</code>, leverages the SQLite VFS that we use for
telemetry to tap into reads, writes, and fsyncs generated by SQLite. In the future
we expect to expand this into several additional modules. Some ideas include a module
that uses Event Tracing for Windows to read events from the Windows kernel and a
module that interposes calls to <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>fsync</code> on Linux.</p>

<p>On the observer side of things, for now we simply insert a marker into the profiler
timeline whenever main thread I/O is reported. Here is a sample screenshot of the
markers in action (the pink stuff for readers who are unfamiliar with SPS markers):</p>

<p><a href="https://dblohm7.ca/images/iomarkers.png"><img src="https://dblohm7.ca/images/iomarkers.png"></a></p>

<p>In <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=867757">bug 867757</a> (under review)
this will become more sophisticated, as SPS will immediately sample the callstack of
the thread whose I/O has been intercepted. This annotated stack will be inserted
directly into the timeline.</p>

<p>There will need to be some UI changes for this to be presented in a reasonable way,
but with both existing patches applied the data is already useful. By firing up
Cleopatra and filtering on either <code>NSPRInterposer</code> or <code>SQLiteInterposer</code>, you can
isolate and view the main thread I/O stacks:</p>

<p><a href="https://dblohm7.ca/images/iofilteredstacks.png"><img src="https://dblohm7.ca/images/iofilteredstacks.png"></a></p>

<p>Hopefully these patches will prove to be beneficial to our efforts to eliminate
main thread I/O.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is the fifth post in my &ldquo;2018 Roundup&rdquo; series. For an index of all entries, please see my
blog entry for <a href="https://dblohm7.ca/blog/2019/01/18/2018-roundup-q1/">Q1</a>.</em></p>

<p>Yes, you are reading the dates correctly: I am posting this over two years after I began this series.
I am trying to get caught up on documenting my past work!</p>

<h3>CI and Developer Tooling</h3>

<p>Given that the launcher process completely changes how our Win32 Firefox builds
start, I needed to update both our CI harnesses, as well as the launcher process
itself. I didn&rsquo;t do much that was particularly noteworthy from a technical
standpoint, but I will mention some important points:</p>

<p>During normal use, the launcher process usually exits immediately after the
browser process is confirmed to have started. This was a deliberate design
decision that I made. Having the launcher process wait for the browser process
to terminate would not do any harm, however I did not want the launcher process
hanging around in Task Manager and being misunderstood by users who are checking
their browser&rsquo;s resource usage.</p>

<p>On the other hand, such a design completely breaks scripts that expect to start
Firefox and be able to synchronously wait for the browser to exit before
continuing! Clearly I needed to provide an opt-in for the latter case, so I added
the <code>--wait-for-browser</code> command-line option. The launcher process also implicitly
enables this mode under a few <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/31a3457890b5698af1277413ee9d9bd6c5955183/browser/app/winlauncher/LauncherProcessWin.cpp#92">other scenarios</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the issue of debugging. Developers were previously used to
attaching to the first <code>firefox.exe</code> process they see and expecting to be debugging
the browser process. With the launcher process enabled by default, this is no
longer the case.</p>

<p>There are few options here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio users may install the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/introducing-the-child-process-debugging-power-tool/">Child Process Debugging Power Tool</a>,
which enables the VS debugger to attach to child processes;</li>
<li>WinDbg users may start their debugger with the <code>-o</code> command-line flag,
or use the <code>Debug child processes also</code> checkbox in the GUI;</li>
<li>I added support for a <code>MOZ_DEBUG_BROWSER_PAUSE</code> environment variable, which
allows developers to set a timeout (in seconds) for the browser process to
print its pid to <code>stdout</code> and wait for a debugger attachment.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Performance Testing</h3>

<p>As I have alluded to in previous posts, I needed to measure the effect of adding
an additional process to the critical path of Firefox startup. Since in-process
testing will not work in this case, I needed to use something that could provide
a holistic view across both launcher and browser processes. I decided to enhance
our existing <code>xperf</code> suite in Talos to support my use case.</p>

<p>I already had prior experience with <code>xperf</code>; I spent a significant part of 2013
working with Joel Maher to put the <code>xperf</code> Talos suite into production. I also
knew that the existing code was not sufficiently generic to be able to handle my
use case.</p>

<p>I threw together a rudimentary <a href="https://github.com/dblohm7/xperf">analysis framework</a>
for working with CSV-exported xperf data. Then, after Joel&rsquo;s review, I vendored
it into <code>mozilla-central</code> and used it to construct an analysis for startup time.
[<em>While a more thorough discussion of this framework is definitely warranted, I
also feel that it is tangential to the discussion at hand; I&rsquo;ll write a dedicated
blog entry about this topic in the future. &ndash; Aaron</em>]</p>

<p>In essence, the analysis considers the following facts when processing an xperf recording:</p>

<ul>
<li>The launcher process will be the first <code>firefox.exe</code> process that runs;</li>
<li>The browser process will be started by the launcher process;</li>
<li>The browser process will fire a <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/startup/mozprofilerprobe.mof">session store window restored</a> event.</li>
</ul>


<p>For our analysis, we needed to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the event showing the first <code>firefox.exe</code> process being created;</li>
<li>Find the session store window restored event from the second <code>firefox.exe</code> process;</li>
<li>Output the time interval between the two events.</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/31a3457890b5698af1277413ee9d9bd6c5955183/testing/talos/talos/xtalos/parse_xperf.py#36">This block of code</a>
demonstrates how that analysis is specified using my analyzer framework.</p>

<p>Overall, these test results were quite positive. We saw a very slight but
imperceptible increase in startup time on machines with solid-state drives,
however the security benefits from the launcher process outweigh this very small
regression.</p>

<p>Most interestingly, we saw a signficant <em>improvement</em> in startup time on Windows
10 machines with magnetic hard disks! As I mentioned in Q2 Part 3, I believe
this improvement is due to reduced hard disk seeking thanks to the launcher
process forcing <code>\windows\system32</code> to the front of the dynamic linker&rsquo;s search
path.</p>

<h3>Error and Experimentation Readiness</h3>

<p>By Q3 I had the launcher process in a state where it was built by default into
Firefox, but it was still opt-in. As I have written previously, we needed the
launcher process to gracefully fail even without having the benefit of various
Gecko services such as preferences and the crash reporter.</p>

<h4>Error Propagation</h4>

<p>Firstly, I created a new class, <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/31a3457890b5698af1277413ee9d9bd6c5955183/widget/windows/WinHeaderOnlyUtils.h#73"><code>WindowsError</code></a>,
that encapsulates all types of Windows error codes. As an aside, I would strongly
encourage all Gecko developers who are writing new code that invokes Windows APIs
to use this class in your error handling.</p>

<p><code>WindowsError</code> is currently able to store Win32 <code>DWORD</code> error codes, <code>NTSTATUS</code>
error codes, and <code>HRESULT</code> error codes. Internally the code is stored as an
<code>HRESULT</code>, since that type has encodings to support the other two. <code>WindowsError</code>
also provides a method to convert its error code to a localized string for
human-readable output.</p>

<p>As for the launcher process itself, nearly every function in the launcher
process returns a <code>mozilla::Result</code>-based type. In case of error, we return a
<code>LauncherResult</code>, which [<em>as of 2018; this has changed more recently &ndash; Aaron</em>]
is a structure containing the error&rsquo;s source file, line number, and <code>WindowsError</code>
describing the failure.</p>

<h4>Detecting Browser Process Failures</h4>

<p>While all <code>Result</code>s in the launcher process may be indicating a successful
start, we may not yet be out of the woods! Consider the possibility that the
various interventions taken by the launcher process might have somehow impaired
the browser process&#8217; ability to start!</p>

<p>To deal with this situation, the launcher process and the browser process share
code that tracks whether both processes successfully started in sequence.</p>

<p>When the launcher process is started, it checks information recorded about the
previous run. If the browser process previously failed to start correctly, the
launcher process disables itself and proceeds to start the browser process
without any of its typical interventions.</p>

<p>Once the browser has successfully started, it reflects the launcher process
state into telemetry, preferences, and <code>about:support</code>.</p>

<p>Future attempts to start Firefox will bypass the launcher process until the
next time the installation&rsquo;s binaries are updated, at which point we reset and
attempt once again to start with the launcher process. We do this in the hope
that whatever was failing in version <em>n</em> might be fixed in version <em>n + 1</em>.</p>

<p>Note that this update behaviour implies that there is no way to forcibly and
permanently disable the launcher process. This is by design: the error detection
feature is designed to prevent the browser from becoming unusable, not to provide
configurability. The launcher process is a security feature and not something
that we should want users adjusting any more than we would want users to be
disabling the capability system or some other important security mitigation. In
fact, my original roadmap for InjectEject called for eventually removing the
failure detection code if the launcher failure rate ever reached zero.</p>

<h4>Experimentation and Emergency</h4>

<p>The pref reflection built into the failure detection system is bi-directional.
This allowed us to ship a release where we ran a study with a fraction of users
running with the launcher process enabled by default.</p>

<p>Once we rolled out the launcher process at 100%, this pref also served as a
useful &ldquo;emergency kill switch&rdquo; that we could have flipped if necessary.</p>

<p>Fortunately our experiments were successful and we rolled the launcher process
out to release at 100% without ever needing the kill switch!</p>

<p>At this point, this pref should probably be removed, as we no longer need nor
want to control launcher process deployment in this way.</p>

<h4>Error Reporting</h4>

<p>When telemetry is enabled, the launcher process is able to convert its
<code>LauncherResult</code> into a ping which is sent in the background by <code>ping-sender</code>.
When telemetry is disabled, we perform a last-ditch effort to surface the error
by logging details about the <code>LauncherResult</code> failure in the Windows Event Log.</p>

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>

<p>Thanks for reading! This concludes my 2018 Roundup series! There is so much more
work from 2018 that I did for this project that I wish I could discuss, but for
security reasons I must refrain. Nonetheless, I hope you enjoyed this series.
Stay tuned for more roundups in the future!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have spent a lot of time this quarter working on <a title="Asynchronous Initialization of Out-of-process Plugins" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=998863">bug 998863</a>, &ldquo;Asynchronous
Initialization of Out-of-process Plugins.&rdquo; While the bug summary is fairly self
explanatory, I would like to provide some more details about why I am doing this
and what kind of work it entails. I would also like to wrap up the post with an
early demonstration of this feature and present some profiles to illustrate the
potential performance improvement.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>The reason that I am undertaking this project is because NPAPI plugin startup
is our most frequent cause of jank. In fact, at the time of this writing, our
<a href="http://telemetry.mozilla.org/chromehangs/">Chrome Hangs telemetry</a> is showing
that 4 out of our top 10 most frequent offending call stacks are related to
plugin initialization and instantiation. Furthermore, creating the
plugin-container.exe child process is the #1 most frequent chrome hang offender
(Note that our Chrome Hang telemetry consists entirely of Windows builds, where
process creation is quite expensive).</p>

<h2>A High-level Breakdown of NPAPI Initialization and Instantiation</h2>

<p>The typical steps involved can be broken down as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Launch the <code>plugin-container</code> process;</li>
<li>Call <code>NP_Initialize</code> to load the plugin;</li>
<li>Create instances by calling <code>NPP_New</code>;</li>
<li>Call <code>NPP_NewStream</code> for instances that load stream data;</li>
<li>If an instance is scriptable, call <code>NPP_GetValue</code> to obtain information
about the plugin&rsquo;s scriptable object.</li>
</ol>


<p>The patch that I am working on modifies steps 1 through 4 to run asynchronously.
Step 5 is a special case &ndash; we asynchronously return a proxy object, but if a
synchronous JS method is called on that object, we must wait for the plugin to
initialize (if it has not yet done so). My hope is that if we have to call a
synchronous JS method on the proxy object, plugin initialization will be far
enough along that the wait will be minimal.</p>

<h2>A Brief Demonstration</h2>

<p>The following video compares two locally-built Nightlies that are identical
except for the asynchronous initialization patch. After loading the browser
with a page containing several embedded Flash objects, we can profile and
observe the effects of this patch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One thing about me that most Mozillians don&rsquo;t know is that, when I first applied to work at MoCo,
I had applied to work on the mobile platform. When all was said and done, it was decided at the time
that I would be a better fit for an opening on Taras Glek&rsquo;s platform performance team.</p>

<p>My first day at Mozilla was October 15, 2012 &ndash; I will be celebrating my seventh anniversary at MoCo in
just a couple short weeks! Some people with similar tenures have suggested to me that we are now
&ldquo;old guard,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m not sure that I feel that way! Anyway, I digress.</p>

<p>The platform performance team eventually evolved into a desktop-focused performance team by late 2013.
By the end of 2015 I had decided that it was time for a change, and by March 2016 I had moved over to
work for Jim Mathies, focusing on Gecko integration with Windows. I ended up spending the next twenty
or so months helping the accessibility team port their Windows implementation over to multiprocess.</p>

<p>Once Firefox Quantum 57 hit the streets, I scoped out and provided technical leadership for the
InjectEject project, whose objective was to tackle some of the root problems with DLL injection that
were causing us grief in Windows-land.</p>

<p>I am proud to say that, over the past three years on Jim&rsquo;s team, I have done the best work of my career.
I&rsquo;d like to thank Brad Lassey (now at Google) for his willingness to bring me over to his group, as well as
Jim, and David Bolter (a11y manager at the time) for their confidence in me. As somebody who had spent most
of his adult life having no confidence in his work whatsoever, their willingness to entrust me with
taking on those risks and responsibilities made an enormous difference in my self esteem and my
professional life.</p>

<p>Over the course of H1 2019, I began to feel restless again. I knew it was time for another change. What
I did not expect was that the agent of that change would be James Willcox, aka Snorp. In Whistler, Snorp
planted the seed in my head that I might want to come over to work with him on GeckoView, within the
mobile group which David was now managing.</p>

<p>The timing seemed perfect, so I made the decision to move to GeckoView. I had to finish tying up some
loose ends with InjectEject, so all the various stakeholders agreed that I&rsquo;d move over at the end of Q3 2019.</p>

<p>Which brings me to this week, when I officially join the GeckoView team. I find it somewhat amusing
that I am now joining the team that evolved from the team that I had originally applied for back in
2012. I have truly come full circle in my career at Mozilla!</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s next?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have a couple of InjectEject bugs that are pretty much finished, but just need some polish and
code reviews before landing.</p></li>
<li><p>For the next month or two at least, I am going to continue to meet weekly with Jim to assist with
the transition as he ramps up new staff on the project.</p></li>
<li><p>I still plan to be the module owner for the Firefox Launcher Process and the MSCOM library, however most
day-to-day work will be done by others going forward;</p></li>
<li><p>I will continue to serve as the mozglue peer in charge of the DLL blocklist and DLL interceptor, with
the same caveat.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Switching over to Android from Windows does not mean that I am leaving my Windows experience at the door; I
would like to continue to be a resource on that front, so I would encourage people to continue to ask me
for advice.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I am very much looking forward to stepping back into the mobile space. My first crack at
mobile was as an intern back in 2003, when I was working with some code that had to run on PalmOS 3.0! I have not
touched Android since I shipped a couple of utility apps back in 2011, so I am looking forward to learning
more about what has changed. I am also looking forward to learning more about native development on Android,
which is something that I never really had a chance to try.</p>

<p>As they used to say on Monty Python&rsquo;s Flying Circus, &ldquo;And now for something completely different!&rdquo;</p>

blog entry for <a href="http://dblohm7.ca/blog/2019/01/18/2018-roundup-q1/">Q1</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Refactoring the DLL Interceptor</h2>

<p>As I have alluded to <a href="http://dblohm7.ca/blog/2016/01/11/bugs-from-hell-injected-third-party-code-plus-detours-equals-a-bad-time/">previously</a>,
Gecko includes a Detours-style API hooking mechanism for Windows. In Gecko, this code is referred to
as the &ldquo;DLL Interceptor.&rdquo; We use the DLL interceptor to instrument various functions within our own
processes. As a prerequisite for future DLL injection mitigations, I needed to spend a good chunk of
Q2 refactoring this code. While I was in there, I took the opportunity to improve the interceptor&rsquo;s
memory efficiency, thus benefitting the Fission MemShrink project. [<em>When these changes landed, we were
not yet tracking the memory savings, but I will include a rough estimate <a href="#vmsharing">later</a> in this post.</em>]</p>

<h3>A Brief Overview of Detours-style API Hooking</h3>

<p>While many distinct function hooking techniques are used in the Windows ecosystem, the Detours-style
hook is one of the most effective and most popular. While I am not going to go into too many specifics
here, I&rsquo;d like to offer a quick overview. In this description, &ldquo;target&rdquo; is the function being hooked.</p>

<p>Here is what happens when a function is detoured:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Allocate a chunk of memory to serve as a &ldquo;trampoline.&rdquo; We must be able to adjust the protection
attributes on that memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Disassemble enough of the target to make room for a <code>jmp</code> instruction. On 32-bit x86 processors,
this requires 5 bytes. x86-64 is more complicated, but generally, to <code>jmp</code> to an absolute address, we
try to make room for 13 bytes.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the instructions from step 2 over to the trampoline.</p></li>
<li><p>At the beginning of the target function, write a <code>jmp</code> to the hook function.</p></li>
<li><p>Append additional instructions to the trampoline that, when executed, will cause the processor to
jump back to the first valid instruction after the <code>jmp</code> written in step 4.</p></li>
<li><p>If the hook function wants to pass control on to the original target function, it calls the
trampoline.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Note that these steps don&rsquo;t occur <em>exactly</em> in the order specified above; I selected the above ordering
in an effort to simplify my description.</p>

<p>Here is my attempt at visualizing the control flow of a detoured function on x86-64:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://dblohm7.ca/images/detours_hook.svg">http://dblohm7.ca/images/detours_hook.svg</a>&#8221;></p>

<h3>Refactoring</h3>

<p>Previously, the DLL interceptor relied on directly manipulating pointers in order to read and write the
various instructions involved in the hook. In <a title="Parameterize memory operations in WindowsDllInterceptor" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432653">bug 1432653</a> I changed things so that the memory
operations are parameterized based on two orthogonal concepts:</p>

<ul>
<li>In-process vs out-of-process memory access: I wanted to be able to abstract reads and writes such
that we could optionally set a hook in another process from our own.</li>
<li>Virtual memory allocation scheme: I wanted to be able to change how trampoline memory was allocated.
Previously, each instance of <code>WindowsDllInterceptor</code> allocated its own page of memory for trampolines,
but each instance also typically only sets one or two hooks. This means that most of the 4KiB page
was unused. Furthermore, since Windows allocates blocks of pages on a 64KiB boundary, this wasted a
lot of precious virtual address space in our 32-bit builds.</li>
</ul>


<p>By refactoring and parameterizing these operations, we ended up with the following combinations:</p>

<ul>
<li>In-process memory access, each <code>WindowsDllInterceptor</code> instance receives its own trampoline space;</li>
<li>In-process memory access, all <code>WindowsDllInterceptor</code> instances within a module <em>share</em> trampoline space;</li>
<li>Out-of-process memory access, each <code>WindowsDllInterceptor</code> instance receives its own trampoline space;</li>
<li>Out-of-process memory access, all <code>WindowsDllInterceptor</code> instances within a module share trampoline space (currently
not implemented as this option is not particularly useful at the moment).</li>
</ul>


<p>Instead of directly manipulating pointers, we now use instances of <code>ReadOnlyTargetFunction</code>,
<code>WritableTargetFunction</code>, and <code>Trampoline</code> to manipulate our code/data. Those classes in turn use the
memory management and virtual memory allocation policies to perform the actual reading and writing.</p>

<h3>Memory Management Policies</h3>

<p>The interceptor now supports two policies, <code>MMPolicyInProcess</code> and <code>MMPolicyOutOfProcess</code>. Each policy
must implement the following memory operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read</li>
<li>Write</li>
<li>Change protection attributes</li>
<li>Reserve trampoline space</li>
<li>Commit trampoline space</li>
</ul>


<p><code>MMPolicyInProcess</code> is implemented using <code>memcpy</code> for read and write, <code>VirtualProtect</code>
for protection attribute changes, and <code>VirtualAlloc</code> for reserving and committing trampoline space.</p>

<p><code>MMPolicyOutOfProcess</code> uses <code>ReadProcessMemory</code> and <code>WriteProcessMemory</code> for read and write. As a perf
optimization, we try to batch reads and writes together to reduce the system call traffic. We obviously
use <code>VirtualProtectEx</code> to adjust protection attributes in the other process.</p>

<p>Out-of-process trampoline reservation and commitment, however, is a bit different and is worth a
separate call-out. We allocate trampoline space using shared memory. It is mapped into the local
process with read+write permissions using <code>MapViewOfFile</code>. The memory is mapped into the remote process
as read+execute using some code that I wrote in <a title="Add out-of-process memory access policies to DLL interceptor" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1451511">bug 1451511</a> that either uses <code>NtMapViewOfSection</code> or
<code>MapViewOfFile2</code>, depending on availability. Individual pages from those chunks are then committed via
<code>VirtualAlloc</code> in the local process and <code>VirtualAllocEx</code> in the remote process. This scheme enables
us to read and write to trampoline memory directly, without needing to do cross-process reads and writes!</p>

<h3>VM Sharing Policies</h3>

<p>The code for these policies is a lot simpler than the code for the memory management policies. We now
have <code>VMSharingPolicyUnique</code> and <code>VMSharingPolicyShared</code>. Each of these policies must implement the
following operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reserve space for up to <em>N</em> trampolines of size <em>K</em>;</li>
<li>Obtain a <code>Trampoline</code> object for the next available <em>K</em>-byte trampoline slot;</li>
<li>Return an iterable collection of all extant trampolines.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>VMSharingPolicyShared</code> is actually implemented by delegating to a <code>static</code> instance of
<code>VMSharingPolicyUnique</code>.</p>

<h3>Implications of Refactoring</h3>

<p>To determine the performance implications, I added timings to our DLL Interceptor unit test. I was
very happy to see that, despite the additional layers of abstraction, the C++ compiler&rsquo;s optimizer was
doing its job: There was no performance impact whatsoever!</p>

<p><a name="vmsharing"></a>Once the refactoring was complete, I switched the default VM Sharing Policy for <code>WindowsDllInterceptor</code>
over to <code>VMSharingPolicyShared</code> in <a title="DLL interceptors should share trampoline VM" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1451524">bug 1451524</a>.</p>

<p>Browsing today&rsquo;s <code>mozilla-central</code> tip, I count 14 locations where we instantiate interceptors inside
<code>xul.dll</code>. Given that not all interceptors are necessarily instantiated at once, I am now offering a
worst-case back-of-the-napkin estimate of the memory savings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each interceptor would likely be consuming 4KiB (most of which is unused) of committed VM. Due to
Windows&#8217; 64 KiB allocation guanularity, each interceptor would be leaving a further 60KiB
of address space in a free but unusable state. Assuming all 14 interceptors were actually instantiated,
they would thus consume a combined 56KiB of committed VM and 840KiB of free but unusable address space.</li>
<li>By sharing trampoline VM, the interceptors would consume only 4KiB combined and waste only 60KiB of
address space, thus yielding savings of 52KiB in committed memory and 780KiB in addressable memory.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Oh, and One More Thing</h3>

<p>Another problem that I discovered during this refactoring was <a title="Repeated failed function hook attempts cause exhaustion of interceptor trampoline space" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1459335">bug 1459335</a>. It turns out that some
of the interceptor&rsquo;s callers were not distinguishing between &ldquo;I have not set this hook yet&rdquo; and &ldquo;I
attempted to set this hook but it failed&rdquo; scenarios. Across several call sites, I discovered that
our code would repeatedly retry to set hooks even when they had previously failed, causing leakage
of trampoline space!</p>

<p>To fix this, I modified the interceptor&rsquo;s interface so that we use one-time initialization APIs to
set hooks; since landing this bug, it is no longer possible for clients of the DLL interceptor to
set a hook that had previously failed to be set.</p>

<p>Quantifying the memory costs of this bug is&hellip; non-trivial, but it suffices to say that fixing
this bug probably resulted in the savings of at least a few hundred KiB in committed VM on
affected machines.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a very busy 2018. So busy, in fact, that I have not been able to devote any time to actually
discussing what I worked on! I had intended to write these posts during the end of December, but a
hardware failure delayed that until the new year. Alas, here we are in 2019, and I am going to do a
series of retrospectives on last year&rsquo;s work, broken up by quarter.</p>

<p>Here is an index of the remaining entries in this series:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dblohm7.ca/blog/2019/01/23/2018-roundup-q2-part1/">2018 Roundup: Q2, Part 1</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The general theme of my work in 2018 was dealing with the DLL injection problem: On Windows,
third parties love to forcibly load their DLLs into other processes &ndash; web browsers in particular,
thus making Firefox a primary target.</p>

<p>Many of these libraries tend to alter Firefox processes in ways that hurt the stability and/or performance
of our code; many chemspill releases have gone out over the years to deal with these problems. While I
could rant for hours over this, the fact is that DLL injection is rampant in the ecosystem of Windows
desktop applications and is not going to disappear any time soon. In the meantime, we need to be able
to deal with it.</p>

<p>Some astute readers might be ready to send me an email or post a comment about how ignorant I am about
the new(-ish) process mitigation policies that are available in newer versions of Windows. While those
features are definitely useful, they are not panaceas:</p>

<ul>
<li>We cannot turn on the &ldquo;Extension Point Disable&rdquo; policy for users of assistive technologies; screen
readers rely heavily on DLL injection using <code>SetWindowsHookEx</code> and <code>SetWinEventHook</code>, both of which
are covered by this policy;</li>
<li>We could enable the &ldquo;Microsoft Binary Signature&rdquo; policy, however that requires us to load our own
DLLs first before enabling; once that happens, it is often already too late: other DLLs have already
injected themselves by the time we are able to activate this policy. (Note that this could easily be
solved if this policy were augmented to also permit loading of any DLL signed by the same organization
as that of the process&rsquo;s executable binary, but Microsoft seems to be unwilling to do this.)</li>
<li>The above mitigations are not universally available. They do not help us on Windows 7.</li>
</ul>


<p>For me, Q1 2018 was all about gathering better data about injected DLLs.</p>

<h2>Learning More About DLLs Injected into Firefox</h2>

<p>One of our major pain points over the years of dealing with injected DLLs has been that the vendor of
the DLL is not always apparent to us. In general, our crash reports and telemetry pings only include
the leaf name of the various DLLs on a user&rsquo;s system. This is intentional on our part: we want to
preserve user privacy. On the other hand, this severely limits our ability to determine which party
is responsible for a particular DLL.</p>

<p>One avenue for obtaining this information is to look at any digital signature that is embedded in the
DLL. By examining the certificate that was used to sign the binary, we can extract the organization
of the cert&rsquo;s owner and include that with our crash reports and telemetry.</p>

<p>In <a title="Include authenticode cert information with crash reports" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1430857">bug 1430857</a> I wrote a bunch of code that enables us to extract that information from signed
binaries using the Windows Authenticode APIs. Originally, in that bug, all of that signature extraction
work happened from within the browser itself, while it was running: It would gather the cert information
on a background thread while the browser was running, and include those annotations in a subsequent
crash dump, should such a thing occur.</p>

<p>After some reflection, I realized that I was not gathering annotations in the right place. As an example,
what if an injected DLL were to trigger a crash before the background thread had a chance to grab
that DLL&rsquo;s cert information?</p>

<p>I realized that the best place to gather this information was in a post-processing step after the
crash dump had been generated, and in fact we already had the right mechanism for doing so: the
<code>minidump-analyzer</code> program was already doing post-processing on Firefox crash dumps before sending
them back to Mozilla. I moved the signature extraction and crash annotation code out of Gecko and
into the analyzer in <a title="Cert annotation performance and reliability improvements" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1436845">bug 1436845</a>.</p>

<p>(As an aside, while working on the <code>minidump-analyzer</code>, I found some problems with how it handled
command line arguments: it was assuming that <code>main</code> passes its <code>argv</code> as UTF-8, which is not true on
Windows. I fixed those issues in <a title="Minidump analyzer assuming utf-8 command-line arguments on Windows" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1437156">bug 1437156</a>.)</p>

<p>In <a title="Add module cert info to modules ping" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1434489">bug 1434489</a> I also ended up adding this information to the &ldquo;modules ping&rdquo; that we have in
telemetry; IIRC this ping is only sent weekly. When the modules ping is requested, we gather the
module cert info asynchronously on a background thread.</p>

<p>Finally, I had to modify Socorro (the back-end for <a href="https://crash-stats.mozilla.com">crash-stats</a>) to
be able to understand the signature annotations and be able to display them via <a title="Add module cert info to crash report "Modules" tab" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1434495">bug 1434495</a>. This
required two commits: one to modify the Socorro stackwalker to merge the module signature information
into the full crash report, and another to add a &ldquo;Signed By&rdquo; column to every report&rsquo;s &ldquo;Modules&rdquo; tab to
display the signature information (Note that this column is only present when at least one module in
a particular crash report contains signature information).</p>

<p>The end result was very satisfying: Most of the injected DLLs in our Windows crash reports are signed,
so it is now much easier to identify their vendors!</p>

<p>This project was very satisifying for me in many ways: First of all, surfacing this information was an
itch that I had been wanting to scratch for quite some time. Secondly, this really was a &ldquo;full stack&rdquo;
project, touching everything from extracting signature info from binaries using C++, all the way up to
writing some back-end code in Python and a little touch of front-end stuff to surface the data in the
web app.</p>

<p>Note that, while this project focused on Windows because of the severity of the library injection
problem on that platform, it would be easy enough to reuse most of this code for macOS builds as well;
the only major work for the latter case would be for extracting signature information from a dylib.
This is not currently a priority for us, though.</p>

    <link href="http://dblohm7.ca/blog/2017/11/16/legacy-firefox-extensions-and-userspace/"/>
    <updated>2017-11-16T13:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dblohm7.ca/blog/2017/11/16/legacy-firefox-extensions-and-userspace</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week&rsquo;s release of Firefox Quantum has prompted all kinds of feedback, both
positive and negative. That is not surprising to anybody &ndash; any software that
has a large number of users is going to be a topic for discussion, especially
when the release in question is undoubtedly a watershed.</p>

<p>While I have <a href="http://dblohm7.ca/blog/2015/08/30/on-webextensions/">previously</a>
blogged about the transition to WebExtensions, now that we have actually passed
through the cutoff for legacy extensions, I have decided to add some new
commentary on the subject.</p>

<p>One analogy that has been used in the discussion of the extension ecosystem is
that of kernelspace and userspace. The crux of the analogy is that Gecko is
equivalent to an operating system kernel, and thus extensions are the user-mode
programs that run atop that kernel. The argument then follows that Mozilla&rsquo;s
deprecation and removal of legacy extension capabilities is akin to &ldquo;breaking&rdquo;
userspace. [<em>Some people who say this are using the same tone as Linus does
whenever he eviscerates Linux developers who break userspace, which is neither
productive nor welcomed by anyone, but I digress.</em>] Unfortunately, that analogy
simply does not map to the legacy extension model.</p>

<h2>Legacy Extensions as Kernel Modules</h2>

<p>The most significant problem with the userspace analogy is that legacy extensions
effectively meld with Gecko and become part of Gecko itself. If we accept the
premise that Gecko is like a monolithic OS kernel, then we must also accept that
the analogical equivalent of loading arbitrary code into that kernel, is the
kernel module. Such components are loaded into the kernel and effectively become
part of it. Their code runs with full privileges. They break whenever
significant changes are made to the kernel itself.</p>

<p>Sound familiar?</p>

<p>Legacy extensions were akin to kernel modules. When there is no abstraction,
there can be no such thing as userspace. This is precisely the problem that
WebExtensions solves!</p>

<h2>Building Out a Legacy API</h2>

<p>Maybe somebody out there is thinking, &ldquo;well what if you took all the APIs that
legacy extensions used, turned that into a &lsquo;userspace,&rsquo; and then just left that
part alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which APIs? Where do we draw the line? Do we check the code coverage for every
legacy addon in AMO and use that to determine what to include?</p>

<p>Remember, there was no abstraction; installed legacy addons are fused to Gecko.
If we pledge not to touch anything that legacy addons might touch, then we
cannot touch anything at all.</p>

<p>Where do we go from here? Freeze an old version of Gecko and host an entire copy
of it inside web content? Compile it to WebAssembly? [<em>Oh God, what have I done?</em>]</p>

<p>If <em>that&rsquo;s</em> not a maintenance burden, I don&rsquo;t know what is!</p>

<h2>A Kernel Analogy for WebExtensions</h2>

<p>Another problem with the legacy-extensions-as-userspace analogy is that it leaves
awkward room for web content, whose API is abstract and well-defined. I do not
think that it is appropriate to consider web content to be equivalent to a
sandboxed application, as sandboxed applications use the same (albeit restricted)
API as normal applications. I would suggest that the presence of WebExtensions
gives us a better kernel analogy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gecko is the kernel;</li>
<li>WebExtensions are privileged user applications;</li>
<li>Web content runs as unprivileged user applications.</li>
</ul>


<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>Declaring that legacy extensions are userspace does not make them so. The way that
the technology actually worked defies the abstract model that the analogy
attempts to impose upon it. On the other hand, we can use the failure of that
analogy to explain why WebExtensions are important and construct an extension
ecosystem that <em>does</em> fit with that analogy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the second time since I have been at Mozilla I have encountered a situation
where hooks are called for notifications of a newly created window, but that
window has not yet been initialized properly, causing the hooks to behave badly.</p>

<p>The first time was inside our window neutering code in IPC, while the second
time was in our accessibility code.</p>

<p>Every time I have seen this, there is code that follows this pattern:</p>

<pre><code class="c++">HWND hwnd = CreateWindowEx(/* ... */);
if (hwnd) {
  // Do some follow-up initialization to hwnd (Using SetProp as an example):
  SetProp(hwnd, "Foo", bar);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This seems innocuous enough, right?</p>

<p>The problem is that <code>CreateWindowEx</code> calls hooks. If those hooks then try to do
something like <code>GetProp(hwnd, "Foo")</code>, that call is going to fail because the
&ldquo;Foo&rdquo; prop has not yet been set.</p>

<p>The key takeaway from this is that, if you are creating a new window, you must
do any follow-up initialization from within your window proc&rsquo;s <code>WM_CREATE</code>
handler. This will guarantee that your window&rsquo;s initialization will have
completed before any hooks are called.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t set any hooks!&rdquo; While this may be true, you
must not forget about hooks set by third-party code.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But those hooks won&rsquo;t know anything about my program&rsquo;s internals, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps, perhaps not. But when those hooks fire, they give third-party software
the opportunity to run. In some cases, those hooks might even cause the thread
to <em>reenter your own code</em>. Your window had better be completely initialized
when this happens!</p>

<p>In the case of my latest discovery of this issue in <a title="Window emulation needs to SetProp inside WM_CREATE" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1380471">bug 1380471</a>, I made it
possible to use a C++11 lambda to simplify this pattern.</p>

<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632680.aspx"><code>CreateWindowEx</code></a>
accepts a <code>lpParam</code> parameter which is then passed to the <code>WM_CREATE</code> handler
as the <code>lpCreateParams</code> member of a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632603.aspx"><code>CREATESTRUCT</code></a>.</p>

<p>By setting <code>lpParam</code> to a pointer to a <code>std::function&lt;void(HWND)&gt;</code>, we may then
supply any callable that we wish for follow-up window initialization.</p>

<p>Using the previous code sample as a baseline, this allows me to revise the code
to safely set a property like this:</p>

<pre><code class="c++">std::function&lt;void(HWND)&gt; onCreate([](HWND aHwnd) -&gt; void {
  SetProp(aHwnd, "Foo", bar);
});

HWND hwnd = CreateWindowEx(/* ... */, &amp;onCreate);
// At this point is already too late to further initialize hwnd!
</code></pre>

<p>Note that since <code>lpParam</code> is always passed during <code>WM_CREATE</code>, which always fires
before <code>CreateWindowEx</code> returns, it is safe for <code>onCreate</code> to live on the stack.</p>

<p>I liked this solution for the a11y case because it preserved the locality of
the initialization code within the function that called <code>CreateWindowEx</code>; the
window proc for this window is implemented in another source file and the
follow-up initialization depends on the context surrounding the <code>CreateWindowEx</code>
call.</p>

<p>Speaking of window procs, here is how that window&rsquo;s <code>WM_CREATE</code> handler invokes
the callable:</p>

<pre><code class="c++">switch (uMsg) {
  case WM_CREATE: {
    auto createStruct = reinterpret_cast&lt;CREATESTRUCT*&gt;(lParam);
    auto createProc = reinterpret_cast&lt;std::function&lt;void(HWND)&gt;*&gt;(
      createStruct-&gt;lpCreateParams);

    if (createProc &amp;&amp; *createProc) {
      (*createProc)(hwnd);
    }

    return 0;
  }
  // ...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> If you see a pattern where further initialization work is being done
on an <code>HWND</code> after a <code>CreateWindowEx</code> call, move that initialization code to your
window&rsquo;s <code>WM_CREATE</code> handler instead.</p>

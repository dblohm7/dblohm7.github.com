  <div class="entry-content"><p>One thing about me that most Mozillians don&rsquo;t know is that, when I first applied to work at MoCo,
I had applied to work on the mobile platform. When all was said and done, it was decided at the time
that I would be a better fit for an opening on Taras Glek&rsquo;s platform performance team.</p>

<p>My first day at Mozilla was October 15, 2012 &ndash; I will be celebrating my seventh anniversary at MoCo in
just a couple short weeks! Some people with similar tenures have suggested to me that we are now
&ldquo;old guard,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m not sure that I feel that way! Anyway, I digress.</p>

<p>The platform performance team eventually evolved into a desktop-focused performance team by late 2013.
By the end of 2015 I had decided that it was time for a change, and by March 2016 I had moved over to
work for Jim Mathies, focusing on Gecko integration with Windows. I ended up spending the next twenty
or so months helping the accessibility team port their Windows implementation over to multiprocess.</p>

<p>Once Firefox Quantum 57 hit the streets, I scoped out and provided technical leadership for the
InjectEject project, whose objective was to tackle some of the root problems with DLL injection that
were causing us grief in Windows-land.</p>

<p>I am proud to say that, over the past three years on Jim&rsquo;s team, I have done the best work of my career.
I&rsquo;d like to thank Brad Lassey (now at Google) for his willingness to bring me over to his group, as well as
Jim, and David Bolter (a11y manager at the time) for their confidence in me. As somebody who had spent most
of his adult life having no confidence in his work whatsoever, their willingness to entrust me with
taking on those risks and responsibilities made an enormous difference in my self esteem and my
professional life.</p>

<p>Over the course of H1 2019, I began to feel restless again. I knew it was time for another change. What
I did not expect was that the agent of that change would be James Willcox, aka Snorp. In Whistler, Snorp
planted the seed in my head that I might want to come over to work with him on GeckoView, within the
mobile group which David was now managing.</p>

<p>The timing seemed perfect, so I made the decision to move to GeckoView. I had to finish tying up some
loose ends with InjectEject, so all the various stakeholders agreed that I&rsquo;d move over at the end of Q3 2019.</p>

<p>Which brings me to this week, when I officially join the GeckoView team, working for Emily Toop. I find
it somewhat amusing that I am now joining the team that evolved from the team that I had originally applied
for back in 2012. I have truly come full circle in my career at Mozilla!</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s next?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have a couple of InjectEject bugs that are pretty much finished, but just need some polish and
code reviews before landing.</p></li>
<li><p>For the next month or two at least, I am going to continue to meet weekly with Jim to assist with
the transition as he ramps up new staff on the project.</p></li>
<li><p>I still plan to be the module owner for the Firefox Launcher Process and the MSCOM library, however most
day-to-day work will be done by others going forward;</p></li>
<li><p>I will continue to serve as the mozglue peer in charge of the DLL blocklist and DLL interceptor, with
the same caveat.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Switching over to Android from Windows does not mean that I am leaving my Windows experience at the door; I
would like to continue to be a resource on that front, so I would encourage people to continue to ask me
for advice.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I am very much looking forward to stepping back into the mobile space. My first crack at
mobile was as an intern back in 2003, when I was working with some code that had to run on PalmOS 3.0! I have not
touched Android since I shipped a couple of utility apps back in 2011, so I am looking forward to learning
more about what has changed. I am also looking forward to learning more about native development on Android,
which is something that I never really had a chance to try.</p>

<p>As they used to say on Monty Python&rsquo;s Flying Circus, &ldquo;And now for something completely different!&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is the second post in my &ldquo;2018 Roundup&rdquo; series. For an index of all entries, please see my
blog entry for <a href="https://dblohm7.ca/blog/2019/01/18/2018-roundup-q1/">Q1</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Refactoring the DLL Interceptor</h2>

<p>As I have alluded to <a href="https://dblohm7.ca/blog/2016/01/11/bugs-from-hell-injected-third-party-code-plus-detours-equals-a-bad-time/">previously</a>,
Gecko includes a Detours-style API hooking mechanism for Windows. In Gecko, this code is referred to
as the &ldquo;DLL Interceptor.&rdquo; We use the DLL interceptor to instrument various functions within our own
processes. As a prerequisite for future DLL injection mitigations, I needed to spend a good chunk of
Q2 refactoring this code. While I was in there, I took the opportunity to improve the interceptor&rsquo;s
memory efficiency, thus benefitting the Fission MemShrink project. [<em>When these changes landed, we were
not yet tracking the memory savings, but I will include a rough estimate <a href="#vmsharing">later</a> in this post.</em>]</p>

<h3>A Brief Overview of Detours-style API Hooking</h3>

<p>While many distinct function hooking techniques are used in the Windows ecosystem, the Detours-style
hook is one of the most effective and most popular. While I am not going to go into too many specifics
here, I&rsquo;d like to offer a quick overview. In this description, &ldquo;target&rdquo; is the function being hooked.</p>

<p>Here is what happens when a function is detoured:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Allocate a chunk of memory to serve as a &ldquo;trampoline.&rdquo; We must be able to adjust the protection
attributes on that memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Disassemble enough of the target to make room for a <code>jmp</code> instruction. On 32-bit x86 processors,
this requires 5 bytes. x86-64 is more complicated, but generally, to <code>jmp</code> to an absolute address, we
try to make room for 13 bytes.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the instructions from step 2 over to the trampoline.</p></li>
<li><p>At the beginning of the target function, write a <code>jmp</code> to the hook function.</p></li>
<li><p>Append additional instructions to the trampoline that, when executed, will cause the processor to
jump back to the first valid instruction after the <code>jmp</code> written in step 4.</p></li>
<li><p>If the hook function wants to pass control on to the original target function, it calls the
trampoline.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Note that these steps don&rsquo;t occur <em>exactly</em> in the order specified above; I selected the above ordering
in an effort to simplify my description.</p>

<p>Here is my attempt at visualizing the control flow of a detoured function on x86-64:</p>

<p><img src="https://dblohm7.ca/images/detours_hook.svg"></p>

<h3>Refactoring</h3>

<p>Previously, the DLL interceptor relied on directly manipulating pointers in order to read and write the
various instructions involved in the hook. In <a title="Parameterize memory operations in WindowsDllInterceptor" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432653">bug 1432653</a> I changed things so that the memory
operations are parameterized based on two orthogonal concepts:</p>

<ul>
<li>In-process vs out-of-process memory access: I wanted to be able to abstract reads and writes such
that we could optionally set a hook in another process from our own.</li>
<li>Virtual memory allocation scheme: I wanted to be able to change how trampoline memory was allocated.
Previously, each instance of <code>WindowsDllInterceptor</code> allocated its own page of memory for trampolines,
but each instance also typically only sets one or two hooks. This means that most of the 4KiB page
was unused. Furthermore, since Windows allocates blocks of pages on a 64KiB boundary, this wasted a
lot of precious virtual address space in our 32-bit builds.</li>
</ul>


<p>By refactoring and parameterizing these operations, we ended up with the following combinations:</p>

<ul>
<li>In-process memory access, each <code>WindowsDllInterceptor</code> instance receives its own trampoline space;</li>
<li>In-process memory access, all <code>WindowsDllInterceptor</code> instances within a module <em>share</em> trampoline space;</li>
<li>Out-of-process memory access, each <code>WindowsDllInterceptor</code> instance receives its own trampoline space;</li>
<li>Out-of-process memory access, all <code>WindowsDllInterceptor</code> instances within a module share trampoline space (currently
not implemented as this option is not particularly useful at the moment).</li>
</ul>


<p>Instead of directly manipulating pointers, we now use instances of <code>ReadOnlyTargetFunction</code>,
<code>WritableTargetFunction</code>, and <code>Trampoline</code> to manipulate our code/data. Those classes in turn use the
memory management and virtual memory allocation policies to perform the actual reading and writing.</p>

<h3>Memory Management Policies</h3>

<p>The interceptor now supports two policies, <code>MMPolicyInProcess</code> and <code>MMPolicyOutOfProcess</code>. Each policy
must implement the following memory operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read</li>
<li>Write</li>
<li>Change protection attributes</li>
<li>Reserve trampoline space</li>
<li>Commit trampoline space</li>
</ul>


<p><code>MMPolicyInProcess</code> is implemented using <code>memcpy</code> for read and write, <code>VirtualProtect</code>
for protection attribute changes, and <code>VirtualAlloc</code> for reserving and committing trampoline space.</p>

<p><code>MMPolicyOutOfProcess</code> uses <code>ReadProcessMemory</code> and <code>WriteProcessMemory</code> for read and write. As a perf
optimization, we try to batch reads and writes together to reduce the system call traffic. We obviously
use <code>VirtualProtectEx</code> to adjust protection attributes in the other process.</p>

<p>Out-of-process trampoline reservation and commitment, however, is a bit different and is worth a
separate call-out. We allocate trampoline space using shared memory. It is mapped into the local
process with read+write permissions using <code>MapViewOfFile</code>. The memory is mapped into the remote process
as read+execute using some code that I wrote in <a title="Add out-of-process memory access policies to DLL interceptor" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1451511">bug 1451511</a> that either uses <code>NtMapViewOfSection</code> or
<code>MapViewOfFile2</code>, depending on availability. Individual pages from those chunks are then committed via
<code>VirtualAlloc</code> in the local process and <code>VirtualAllocEx</code> in the remote process. This scheme enables
us to read and write to trampoline memory directly, without needing to do cross-process reads and writes!</p>

<h3>VM Sharing Policies</h3>

<p>The code for these policies is a lot simpler than the code for the memory management policies. We now
have <code>VMSharingPolicyUnique</code> and <code>VMSharingPolicyShared</code>. Each of these policies must implement the
following operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reserve space for up to <em>N</em> trampolines of size <em>K</em>;</li>
<li>Obtain a <code>Trampoline</code> object for the next available <em>K</em>-byte trampoline slot;</li>
<li>Return an iterable collection of all extant trampolines.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>VMSharingPolicyShared</code> is actually implemented by delegating to a <code>static</code> instance of
<code>VMSharingPolicyUnique</code>.</p>

<h3>Implications of Refactoring</h3>

<p>To determine the performance implications, I added timings to our DLL Interceptor unit test. I was
very happy to see that, despite the additional layers of abstraction, the C++ compiler&rsquo;s optimizer was
doing its job: There was no performance impact whatsoever!</p>

<p><a name="vmsharing"></a>Once the refactoring was complete, I switched the default VM Sharing Policy for <code>WindowsDllInterceptor</code>
over to <code>VMSharingPolicyShared</code> in <a title="DLL interceptors should share trampoline VM" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1451524">bug 1451524</a>.</p>

<p>Browsing today&rsquo;s <code>mozilla-central</code> tip, I count 14 locations where we instantiate interceptors inside
<code>xul.dll</code>. Given that not all interceptors are necessarily instantiated at once, I am now offering a
worst-case back-of-the-napkin estimate of the memory savings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each interceptor would likely be consuming 4KiB (most of which is unused) of committed VM. Due to
Windows&#8217; 64 KiB allocation guanularity, each interceptor would be leaving a further 60KiB
of address space in a free but unusable state. Assuming all 14 interceptors were actually instantiated,
they would thus consume a combined 56KiB of committed VM and 840KiB of free but unusable address space.</li>
<li>By sharing trampoline VM, the interceptors would consume only 4KiB combined and waste only 60KiB of
address space, thus yielding savings of 52KiB in committed memory and 780KiB in addressable memory.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Oh, and One More Thing</h3>

<p>Another problem that I discovered during this refactoring was <a title="Repeated failed function hook attempts cause exhaustion of interceptor trampoline space" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1459335">bug 1459335</a>. It turns out that some
of the interceptor&rsquo;s callers were not distinguishing between &ldquo;I have not set this hook yet&rdquo; and &ldquo;I
attempted to set this hook but it failed&rdquo; scenarios. Across several call sites, I discovered that
our code would repeatedly retry to set hooks even when they had previously failed, causing leakage
of trampoline space!</p>

<p>To fix this, I modified the interceptor&rsquo;s interface so that we use one-time initialization APIs to
set hooks; since landing this bug, it is no longer possible for clients of the DLL interceptor to
set a hook that had previously failed to be set.</p>

<p>Quantifying the memory costs of this bug is&hellip; non-trivial, but it suffices to say that fixing
this bug probably resulted in the savings of at least a few hundred KiB in committed VM on
affected machines.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today&rsquo;s post, folks! Thanks for reading! Coming up in Q2, Part 2: Implementing a Skeletal Launcher Process</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a very busy 2018. So busy, in fact, that I have not been able to devote any time to actually
discussing what I worked on! I had intended to write these posts during the end of December, but a
hardware failure delayed that until the new year. Alas, here we are in 2019, and I am going to do a
series of retrospectives on last year&rsquo;s work, broken up by quarter.</p>

<p>Here is an index of the remaining entries in this series:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://dblohm7.ca/blog/2019/01/23/2018-roundup-q2-part1/">2018 Roundup: Q2, Part 1</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The general theme of my work in 2018 was dealing with the DLL injection problem: On Windows,
third parties love to forcibly load their DLLs into other processes &ndash; web browsers in particular,
thus making Firefox a primary target.</p>

<p>Many of these libraries tend to alter Firefox processes in ways that hurt the stability and/or performance
of our code; many chemspill releases have gone out over the years to deal with these problems. While I
could rant for hours over this, the fact is that DLL injection is rampant in the ecosystem of Windows
desktop applications and is not going to disappear any time soon. In the meantime, we need to be able
to deal with it.</p>

<p>Some astute readers might be ready to send me an email or post a comment about how ignorant I am about
the new(-ish) process mitigation policies that are available in newer versions of Windows. While those
features are definitely useful, they are not panaceas:</p>

<ul>
<li>We cannot turn on the &ldquo;Extension Point Disable&rdquo; policy for users of assistive technologies; screen
readers rely heavily on DLL injection using <code>SetWindowsHookEx</code> and <code>SetWinEventHook</code>, both of which
are covered by this policy;</li>
<li>We could enable the &ldquo;Microsoft Binary Signature&rdquo; policy, however that requires us to load our own
DLLs first before enabling; once that happens, it is often already too late: other DLLs have already
injected themselves by the time we are able to activate this policy. (Note that this could easily be
solved if this policy were augmented to also permit loading of any DLL signed by the same organization
as that of the process&rsquo;s executable binary, but Microsoft seems to be unwilling to do this.)</li>
<li>The above mitigations are not universally available. They do not help us on Windows 7.</li>
</ul>


<p>For me, Q1 2018 was all about gathering better data about injected DLLs.</p>

<h2>Learning More About DLLs Injected into Firefox</h2>

<p>One of our major pain points over the years of dealing with injected DLLs has been that the vendor of
the DLL is not always apparent to us. In general, our crash reports and telemetry pings only include
the leaf name of the various DLLs on a user&rsquo;s system. This is intentional on our part: we want to
preserve user privacy. On the other hand, this severely limits our ability to determine which party
is responsible for a particular DLL.</p>

<p>One avenue for obtaining this information is to look at any digital signature that is embedded in the
DLL. By examining the certificate that was used to sign the binary, we can extract the organization
of the cert&rsquo;s owner and include that with our crash reports and telemetry.</p>

<p>In <a title="Include authenticode cert information with crash reports" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1430857">bug 1430857</a> I wrote a bunch of code that enables us to extract that information from signed
binaries using the Windows Authenticode APIs. Originally, in that bug, all of that signature extraction
work happened from within the browser itself, while it was running: It would gather the cert information
on a background thread while the browser was running, and include those annotations in a subsequent
crash dump, should such a thing occur.</p>

<p>After some reflection, I realized that I was not gathering annotations in the right place. As an example,
what if an injected DLL were to trigger a crash before the background thread had a chance to grab
that DLL&rsquo;s cert information?</p>

<p>I realized that the best place to gather this information was in a post-processing step after the
crash dump had been generated, and in fact we already had the right mechanism for doing so: the
<code>minidump-analyzer</code> program was already doing post-processing on Firefox crash dumps before sending
them back to Mozilla. I moved the signature extraction and crash annotation code out of Gecko and
into the analyzer in <a title="Cert annotation performance and reliability improvements" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1436845">bug 1436845</a>.</p>

<p>(As an aside, while working on the <code>minidump-analyzer</code>, I found some problems with how it handled
command line arguments: it was assuming that <code>main</code> passes its <code>argv</code> as UTF-8, which is not true on
Windows. I fixed those issues in <a title="Minidump analyzer assuming utf-8 command-line arguments on Windows" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1437156">bug 1437156</a>.)</p>

<p>In <a title="Add module cert info to modules ping" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1434489">bug 1434489</a> I also ended up adding this information to the &ldquo;modules ping&rdquo; that we have in
telemetry; IIRC this ping is only sent weekly. When the modules ping is requested, we gather the
module cert info asynchronously on a background thread.</p>

<p>Finally, I had to modify Socorro (the back-end for <a href="https://crash-stats.mozilla.com">crash-stats</a>) to
be able to understand the signature annotations and be able to display them via <a title="Add module cert info to crash report "Modules" tab" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1434495">bug 1434495</a>. This
required two commits: one to modify the Socorro stackwalker to merge the module signature information
into the full crash report, and another to add a &ldquo;Signed By&rdquo; column to every report&rsquo;s &ldquo;Modules&rdquo; tab to
display the signature information (Note that this column is only present when at least one module in
a particular crash report contains signature information).</p>

<p>The end result was very satisfying: Most of the injected DLLs in our Windows crash reports are signed,
so it is now much easier to identify their vendors!</p>

<p>This project was very satisifying for me in many ways: First of all, surfacing this information was an
itch that I had been wanting to scratch for quite some time. Secondly, this really was a &ldquo;full stack&rdquo;
project, touching everything from extracting signature info from binaries using C++, all the way up to
writing some back-end code in Python and a little touch of front-end stuff to surface the data in the
web app.</p>

<p>Note that, while this project focused on Windows because of the severity of the library injection
problem on that platform, it would be easy enough to reuse most of this code for macOS builds as well;
the only major work for the latter case would be for extracting signature information from a dylib.
This is not currently a priority for us, though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week&rsquo;s release of Firefox Quantum has prompted all kinds of feedback, both
positive and negative. That is not surprising to anybody &ndash; any software that
has a large number of users is going to be a topic for discussion, especially
when the release in question is undoubtedly a watershed.</p>

<p>While I have <a href="https://dblohm7.ca/blog/2015/08/30/on-webextensions/">previously</a>
blogged about the transition to WebExtensions, now that we have actually passed
through the cutoff for legacy extensions, I have decided to add some new
commentary on the subject.</p>

<p>One analogy that has been used in the discussion of the extension ecosystem is
that of kernelspace and userspace. The crux of the analogy is that Gecko is
equivalent to an operating system kernel, and thus extensions are the user-mode
programs that run atop that kernel. The argument then follows that Mozilla&rsquo;s
deprecation and removal of legacy extension capabilities is akin to &ldquo;breaking&rdquo;
userspace. [<em>Some people who say this are using the same tone as Linus does
whenever he eviscerates Linux developers who break userspace, which is neither
productive nor welcomed by anyone, but I digress.</em>] Unfortunately, that analogy
simply does not map to the legacy extension model.</p>

<h2>Legacy Extensions as Kernel Modules</h2>

<p>The most significant problem with the userspace analogy is that legacy extensions
effectively meld with Gecko and become part of Gecko itself. If we accept the
premise that Gecko is like a monolithic OS kernel, then we must also accept that
the analogical equivalent of loading arbitrary code into that kernel, is the
kernel module. Such components are loaded into the kernel and effectively become
part of it. Their code runs with full privileges. They break whenever
significant changes are made to the kernel itself.</p>

<p>Sound familiar?</p>

<p>Legacy extensions were akin to kernel modules. When there is no abstraction,
there can be no such thing as userspace. This is precisely the problem that
WebExtensions solves!</p>

<h2>Building Out a Legacy API</h2>

<p>Maybe somebody out there is thinking, &ldquo;well what if you took all the APIs that
legacy extensions used, turned that into a &lsquo;userspace,&rsquo; and then just left that
part alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which APIs? Where do we draw the line? Do we check the code coverage for every
legacy addon in AMO and use that to determine what to include?</p>

<p>Remember, there was no abstraction; installed legacy addons are fused to Gecko.
If we pledge not to touch anything that legacy addons might touch, then we
cannot touch anything at all.</p>

<p>Where do we go from here? Freeze an old version of Gecko and host an entire copy
of it inside web content? Compile it to WebAssembly? [<em>Oh God, what have I done?</em>]</p>

<p>If <em>that&rsquo;s</em> not a maintenance burden, I don&rsquo;t know what is!</p>

<h2>A Kernel Analogy for WebExtensions</h2>

<p>Another problem with the legacy-extensions-as-userspace analogy is that it leaves
awkward room for web content, whose API is abstract and well-defined. I do not
think that it is appropriate to consider web content to be equivalent to a
sandboxed application, as sandboxed applications use the same (albeit restricted)
API as normal applications. I would suggest that the presence of WebExtensions
gives us a better kernel analogy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gecko is the kernel;</li>
<li>WebExtensions are privileged user applications;</li>
<li>Web content runs as unprivileged user applications.</li>
</ul>


<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>Declaring that legacy extensions are userspace does not make them so. The way that
the technology actually worked defies the abstract model that the analogy
attempts to impose upon it. On the other hand, we can use the failure of that
analogy to explain why WebExtensions are important and construct an extension
ecosystem that <em>does</em> fit with that analogy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the second time since I have been at Mozilla I have encountered a situation
where hooks are called for notifications of a newly created window, but that
window has not yet been initialized properly, causing the hooks to behave badly.</p>

<p>The first time was inside our window neutering code in IPC, while the second
time was in our accessibility code.</p>

<p>Every time I have seen this, there is code that follows this pattern:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c++'><span class='line'><span class="n">HWND</span> <span class="n">hwnd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">CreateWindowEx</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="cm">/* ... */</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hwnd</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">// Do some follow-up initialization to hwnd (Using SetProp as an example):</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">SetProp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hwnd</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Foo&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This seems innocuous enough, right?</p>

<p>The problem is that <code>CreateWindowEx</code> calls hooks. If those hooks then try to do
something like <code>GetProp(hwnd, "Foo")</code>, that call is going to fail because the
&ldquo;Foo&rdquo; prop has not yet been set.</p>

<p>The key takeaway from this is that, if you are creating a new window, you must
do any follow-up initialization from within your window proc&rsquo;s <code>WM_CREATE</code>
handler. This will guarantee that your window&rsquo;s initialization will have
completed before any hooks are called.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t set any hooks!&rdquo; While this may be true, you
must not forget about hooks set by third-party code.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But those hooks won&rsquo;t know anything about my program&rsquo;s internals, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps, perhaps not. But when those hooks fire, they give third-party software
the opportunity to run. In some cases, those hooks might even cause the thread
to <em>reenter your own code</em>. Your window had better be completely initialized
when this happens!</p>

<p>In the case of my latest discovery of this issue in <a title="Window emulation needs to SetProp inside WM_CREATE" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1380471">bug 1380471</a>, I made it
possible to use a C++11 lambda to simplify this pattern.</p>

<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632680.aspx"><code>CreateWindowEx</code></a>
accepts a <code>lpParam</code> parameter which is then passed to the <code>WM_CREATE</code> handler
as the <code>lpCreateParams</code> member of a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632603.aspx"><code>CREATESTRUCT</code></a>.</p>

<p>By setting <code>lpParam</code> to a pointer to a <code>std::function&lt;void(HWND)&gt;</code>, we may then
supply any callable that we wish for follow-up window initialization.</p>

<p>Using the previous code sample as a baseline, this allows me to revise the code
to safely set a property like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c++'><span class='line'><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">function</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">HWND</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">onCreate</span><span class="p">([](</span><span class="n">HWND</span> <span class="n">aHwnd</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">SetProp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">aHwnd</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Foo&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">HWND</span> <span class="n">hwnd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">CreateWindowEx</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="cm">/* ... */</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">onCreate</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// At this point is already too late to further initialize hwnd!</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that since <code>lpParam</code> is always passed during <code>WM_CREATE</code>, which always fires
before <code>CreateWindowEx</code> returns, it is safe for <code>onCreate</code> to live on the stack.</p>

<p>I liked this solution for the a11y case because it preserved the locality of
the initialization code within the function that called <code>CreateWindowEx</code>; the
window proc for this window is implemented in another source file and the
follow-up initialization depends on the context surrounding the <code>CreateWindowEx</code>
call.</p>

<p>Speaking of window procs, here is how that window&rsquo;s <code>WM_CREATE</code> handler invokes
the callable:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> If you see a pattern where further initialization work is being done
on an <code>HWND</code> after a <code>CreateWindowEx</code> call, move that initialization code to your
window&rsquo;s <code>WM_CREATE</code> handler instead.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the past I have argued that our Nightly builds, both debug and release, should
use <code>CRITICAL_SECTION</code>s (with full debug info) for our implementation of
<code>mozilla::Mutex</code>. I&rsquo;d like to illustrate some reasons why this is so useful.</p>

<h2>They enable more utility in WinDbg extensions</h2>

<p>Every time you initialize a <code>CRITICAL_SECTION</code>, Windows inserts the CS&rsquo;s
debug info into a process-wide linked list. This enables their discovery by
the Windows debugging engine, and makes the <code>!cs</code>, <code>!critsec</code>, and <code>!locks</code>
commands more useful.</p>

<h2>They enable profiling of their initialization and acquisition</h2>

<p>When the &ldquo;Create user mode stack trace database&rdquo; gflag is enabled, Windows
records the call stack of the thread that called <code>InitializeCriticalSection</code>
on that CS. Windows also records the call stack of the owning thread once
it has acquired the CS. This can be very useful for debugging deadlocks.</p>

<h2>They track their contention counts</h2>

<p>Since every CS has been placed in a process-wide linked list, we may now ask
the debugger to dump statistics about every live CS in the process. In
particular, we can ask the debugger to output the contention counts for each
CS in the process. After running a workload against Nightly, we may then take
the contention output, sort it descendingly, and be able to determine which
<code>CRITICAL_SECTION</code>s are the most contended in the process.</p>

<p>We may then want to more closely inspect the hottest CSes to determine whether
there is anything that we can do to reduce contention and all of the extra
context switching that entails.</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>When we use <code>SRWLOCK</code>s or initialize our <code>CRITICAL_SECTION</code>s with the
<code>CRITICAL_SECTION_NO_DEBUG_INFO</code> flag, we are denying ourselves access to this
information. That&rsquo;s fine on release builds, but on Nightly I think it is worth
having around. While I realize that most Mozilla developers have not used this
until now (otherwise I would not be writing this blog post), this rich debugger
info is one of those things that you do not miss until you do not have it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My colleague <del>bsmedberg</del> njn is going to be removing asynchronous plugin
initialization in <a title="Remove support for async plugin init" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1352575">bug 1352575</a>. Sadly the feature never became solid enough
to remain enabled on release, so we cut our losses and cancelled the project
early in 2016. Now that code is just a bunch of dead weight. With the
deprecation of non-Flash NPAPI plugins in Firefox 52, our developers are now
working on simplifying the remaining NPAPI code as much as possible.</p>

<p>Obviously the removal of that code does not prevent me from discussing some of
the more interesting facets of that work.</p>

<p>Today I am going to talk about how async plugin init worked when web content
attempted to access a property on a plugin&rsquo;s scriptable object, when that
plugin had not yet completed its asynchronous initialization.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Plugins/Guide/Scripting_plugins">described on MDN</a>,
the DOM queries a plugin for scriptability by calling <code>NPP_GetValue</code> with the
<code>NPPVpluginScriptableNPObject</code> constant. With async plugin init, we did not
return the true NPAPI scriptable object back to the DOM. Instead we returned
a surrogate object. This meant that we did not need to synchronously wait for
the plugin to initialize before returning a result back to the DOM.</p>

<p>If the DOM subsequently called into that surrogate object, the surrogate would
be forced to synchronize with the plugin. There was a limit on how much fakery
the async surrogate could do once the DOM needed a definitive answer &ndash; after
all, the NPAPI itself is entirely synchronous. While you may question whether
the asynchronous surrogate actually bought us any responsiveness, performance
profiles and measurements that I took at the time did indeed demonstrate that
the asynchronous surrogate did buy us enough additional concurrency to make it
worthwhile. A good number of plugin instantiations were able to complete in
time before the DOM had made a single invocation on the surrogate.</p>

<p>Once the surrogate object had synchronized with the plugin, it would then mostly
act as a pass-through to the plugin&rsquo;s real NPAPI scriptable object, with one
notable exception: property accesses.</p>

<p>The reason for this is not necessarily obvious, so allow me to elaborate:</p>

<p>The DOM usually sets up a scriptable object as follows:</p>

<pre><samp>
this.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__
</samp></pre>


<ul>
<li>Where <code>this</code> is the WebIDL object (ie, content&rsquo;s <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> element);</li>
<li>Whose prototype is the NPAPI scriptable object;</li>
<li>Whose prototype is the shared WebIDL prototype;</li>
<li>Whose prototype is <code>Object.prototype</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>NPAPI is reentrant (some might say <em>insanely</em> reentrant). It is possible (and
indeed common) for a plugin to set properties on the WebIDL object from within
the plugin&rsquo;s <code>NPP_New</code>.</p>

<p>Suppose that the DOM tries to access a property on the plugin&rsquo;s WebIDL object
that is normally set by the plugin&rsquo;s <code>NPP_New</code>. In the asynchronous case, the
plugin&rsquo;s initialization might still be in progress, so that property might not
yet exist.</p>

<p>In the case where the property does not yet exist on the WebIDL object, JavaScript
fails to retrieve an &ldquo;own&rdquo; property. It then moves on to the first prototype
and attempts to resolve the property on that. As outlined above, this prototype
would actually be the async surrogate. The async surrogate would then be in a
situation where it must absolutely produce a definitive result, so this would
trigger synchronization with the plugin. At this point the plugin would be
guaranteed to have finished initializing.</p>

<p>Now we have a problem: JS was already examining the NPAPI scriptable object when
it blocked to synchronize with the plugin. Meanwhile, the plugin went ahead and
set properties (including the one that we&rsquo;re interested in) on the WebIDL object.
By the time that JS execution resumes, it would already be looking too far up the
prototype chain to see those new properties!</p>

<p>The surrogate needed to be aware of this when it synchronized with the plugin
during a property access. If the plugin had already completed its initialization
(thus rendering synchronization unnecessary), the surrogate would simply pass the
property access on to the real NPAPI scriptable object. On the other hand, if a
synchronization was performed, the surrogate would first retry the WebIDL object
by querying for the WebIDL object&rsquo;s &ldquo;own&rdquo; properties, and return the own property
if it now existed. If no own property existed on the WebIDL object, then the
surrogate would revert to its &ldquo;pass through all the things&rdquo; behaviour.</p>

<p>If I hadn&rsquo;t made the asynchronous surrogate scriptable object do that, we would
have ended up with a strange situation where the DOM&rsquo;s initial property access
on an embed could fail non-deterministically during page load.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s enough chatter for today. I enjoy blogging about my crazy hacks that make
the impossible, umm&hellip; possible, so maybe I&rsquo;ll write some more of these in the
future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In February of this year I switched teams: After 3+ years on Mozilla&rsquo;s
Performance Team, and after having the word &ldquo;performance&rdquo; in my job description
in some form or another for several years prior to that, I decided that it was
time for me to move on to new challenges. Fortunately the Platform org was
willing to have me set up shop under the (e10s|sandboxing|platform integration)
umbrella.</p>

<p>I am pretty excited about this new role!</p>

<p>My first project is to sort out the accessibility situation under Windows e10s.
This started back at Mozlando last December. A number of engineers from across
the Platform org, plus me, got together to brainstorm. Not too long after we had
all returned home, I ended up making a suggestion on an email thread that has
evolved into the core concept that I am currently attempting. As is typical at
Mozilla, no deed goes unpunished, so I have been asked to flesh out my ideas.
An overview of this plan is available on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis/Accessibility/Windows">wiki</a>.</p>

<p>My hope is that I&rsquo;ll be able to deliver a working, &ldquo;version 0.9&rdquo; type of demo
in time for our London all-hands at the end of Q2. Hopefully we will be able to
deliver on that!</p>

<h2>Some Additional Notes</h2>

<p>I am using this section of the blog post to make some additional notes. I don&rsquo;t
feel that these ideas are strong enough to commit to a wiki yet, but I do want
them to be publicly available.</p>

<p>Once concern that our colleagues at NVAccess have identified is that the
current COM interfaces are too chatty; this is a major reason why screen
readers frequently inject libraries into the Firefox address space. If we serve
our content a11y objects as remote COM objects, there is concern that performance
would suffer. This concern is not due to latency, but rather due to frequency
of calls; one function call does not provide sufficient information to the a11y
client. As a result, multiple round trips are required to fetch all of the
information that is required for a particular DOM node.</p>

<p>My gut feeling about this is that this is probably a legitimate concern, however
we cannot make good decisions without quantifying the performance. My plan going
forward is to proceed with a na&iuml;ve implementation of COM remoting to start,
followed by work on reducing round trips as necessary.</p>

<h2>Smart Proxies</h2>

<p>One idea that was discussed is the idea of the content process speculatively
sending information to the chrome process that might be needed in the future.
For example, if we have an <code>IAccessible</code>, we can expect that multiple properties
will be queried off that interface. A smart proxy could ship that data across
the RPC channel during marshaling so that querying that additional information
does not require additional round trips.</p>

<p>COM makes this possible using &ldquo;handler marshaling.&rdquo; I have dug up some
information about how to do this and am posting it here for posterity:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As of today I have added a new command to <code>mozdbgext</code>: <code>!iat</code>.</p>

<p>The syntax is pretty simple:</p>

<p><code>!iat &lt;hexadecimal address&gt;</code></p>

<p>This address shouldn&rsquo;t be just any pointer; it should be the address of an
entry in the current module&rsquo;s import address table (IAT). These addresses
are typically very identifiable by the <code>_imp_</code> prefix in their symbol names.</p>

<p>The purpose of this extension is to look up the name of the DLL from whom the
function is being imported. Furthermore, the extension checks the expected
target address of the import with the actual target address of the import. This
allows us to detect API hooking via IAT patching.</p>

<h3>An Example Session</h3>

<p>I fired up a local copy of Nightly, attached a debugger to it, and dumped the
call stack of its main thread:</p>

</samp></pre>


<p>Let us examine the code at frame 3:</p>

<pre><samp>
14069042 6a04            push    4
14069044 68ff1d0000      push    1DFFh
14069049 8b5508          mov     edx,dword ptr [ebp+8]
1406904c 2b55f8          sub     edx,dword ptr [ebp-8]
1406904f 52              push    edx
14069050 6a00            push    0
14069052 6a00            push    0
14069054 ff159cc57d19    call    dword ptr [xul!_imp__MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx (197dc59c)]
1406905a 8945f4          mov     dword ptr [ebp-0Ch],eax
</samp></pre>


<p>Notice the function call to <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx</code> occurs indirectly;
the call instruction is referencing a pointer within the <code>xul.dll</code> binary
itself. This is the IAT entry that corresponds to that function.</p>

<p>Now, if I load <code>mozdbgext</code>, I can take the address of that IAT entry and execute
the following command:</p>

<pre><samp>
0:000> !iat 0x197dc59c
Expected target: USER32.dll!MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx
Actual target: USER32!MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx+0x0
</samp></pre>


<p><code>!iat</code> has done two things for us:</p>

<ol>
<li>It did a reverse lookup to determine the module and function name for the
import that corresponds to that particular IAT entry; and</li>
<li>It followed the IAT pointer and determined the symbol at the target address.</li>
</ol>


<p>Normally we want both the expected and actual targets to match. If they don&rsquo;t,
we should investigate further, as this mismatch may indicate that the IAT has
been patched by a third party.</p>

<p>Note that <code>!iat</code> command is breakpad aware (provided that you&rsquo;ve already
loaded the symbols using <code>!bploadsyms</code>) but can fall back to the Microsoft
symbol engine as necessary.</p>

<p>Further note that the <code>!iat</code> command does not yet accept the <code>_imp_</code> symbolic
names for the IAT entries, you need to enter the hexadecimal representation of
the pointer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A well-known problem at Mozilla is that, while most of our desktop users run
Windows, most of Mozilla&rsquo;s developers do not. There are a lot of problems that
result from that, but one of the most frustrating to me is that sometimes
those of us that actually use Windows for development find ourselves at a
disadvantage when it comes to tooling or other productivity enhancers.</p>

<p>In many ways this problem is also a Catch-22: People don&rsquo;t want to use Windows
for many reasons, but tooling is big part of the problem. OTOH, nobody is
motivated to improve the tooling situation if nobody is actually going to
use them.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago my frustrations with the situation boiled over when I
learned that our <code>Cpp</code> unit test suite could not log symbolicated call stacks,
resulting in my filing of <a title="cppunittests do not look up breakpad symbols for logged stack traces" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1238305">bug 1238305</a> and <a title="Set _NT_SYMBOL_PATH on Windows test machines" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1240605">bug 1240605</a>. Not only could we
not log those stacks, in many situations we could not view them in a debugger
either.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that PDB files consume a large amount of disk space, we don&rsquo;t
keep those when building from integration or try repositories. Unfortunately
they are be quite useful to have when there is a build failure. Most of our
integration builds, however, do include breakpad symbols. Developers may also
explicitly <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/TryServer#Getting_debug_symbols">request symbols</a>
for their try builds.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I had begun working on a WinDbg debugger extension that
was tailored to Mozilla development. It had mostly bitrotted over time, but I
decided to resurrect it for a new purpose: to help WinDbg<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">*</a></sup>
grok breakpad.</p>

<h2>Enter mozdbgext</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dblohm7/mozdbgext"><code>mozdbgext</code></a> is the result. This extension
adds a few commands that makes Win32 debugging with breakpad a little bit easier.</p>

<p>The original plan was that I wanted <code>mozdbgext</code> to load breakpad symbols and then
insert them into the debugger&rsquo;s symbol table via the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff537943%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>IDebugSymbols3::AddSyntheticSymbol</code></a>
API. Unfortunately the design of this API is not well equipped for bulk loading
of synthetic symbols: each individual symbol insertion causes the debugger to
re-sort its entire symbol table. Since <code>xul.dll</code>&rsquo;s quantity of symbols is in the
six-figure range, using this API to load that quantity of symbols is
prohibitively expensive. I tweeted a Microsoft PM who works on Debugging Tools
for Windows, asking if there would be any improvements there, but it sounds like
this is not going to be happening any time soon.</p>

<p>My original plan would have been ideal from a UX perspective: the breakpad
symbols would look just like any other symbols in the debugger and could be
accessed and manipulated using the same set of commands. Since synthetic symbols
would not work for me in this case, I went for &ldquo;Plan B:&rdquo; Extension commands that
are separate from, but analagous to, regular WinDbg commands.</p>

<p>I plan to continuously improve the commands that are available. Until I have a
proper README checked in, I&rsquo;ll introduce the commands here.</p>

<h3>Loading the Extension</h3>

<ol>
<li>Use the <code>.load</code> command: <code>.load &lt;path_to_mozdbgext_dll&gt;</code></li>
</ol>


<h3>Loading the Breakpad Symbols</h3>

<ol>
<li>Extract the breakpad symbols into a directory.</li>
<li>In the debugger, enter <code>!bploadsyms &lt;path_to_breakpad_symbol_directory&gt;</code></li>
<li>Note that this command will take some time to load all the relevant symbols.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Working with Breakpad Symbols</h3>

<p><strong>Note: You must have successfully run the <code>!bploadsyms</code> command first!</strong></p>

<p>As a general guide, I am attempting to name each breakpad command similarly to
the native WinDbg command, except that the command name is prefixed by <code>!bp</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stack trace: <code>!bpk</code></li>
<li>Find nearest symbol to address: <code>!bpln &lt;address&gt;</code> where <em>address</em> is specified
as a hexadecimal value.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Downloading windbgext</h3>

<p>I have pre-built binaries (<a href="https://github.com/dblohm7/mozdbgext/blob/master/bin/32/mozdbgext.dll?raw=true">32-bit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dblohm7/mozdbgext/blob/master/bin/64/mozdbgext.dll?raw=true">64-bit</a>) available for download.</p>

<p>Note that there are several other commands that are &ldquo;roughed-in&rdquo; at this point
and do not work correctly yet. Please stick to the documented commands at this
time.</p>

<hr />

<p><sup><a href="#r1" id="fn1">*</a></sup> When I write &ldquo;WinDbg&rdquo;, I am really
referring to any debugger in the <em>Debugging Tools for Windows</em> package,
including <code>cdb</code>.</p>
